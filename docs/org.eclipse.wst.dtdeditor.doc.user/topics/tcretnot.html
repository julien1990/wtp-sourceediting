<h1 class="topictitle1">Creating notations </h1>
<div><p>Notations are means of associating a binary description with an
entity or attribute. The most common uses of notations are to include familiar
types of binary references, such as GIFs and JPGs, in an XML file.</p><div class="skipspace"><p>For example, you are making a catalogue of your clothing and want
to include an image of one of your shirts. You would have to create a notation
similar to this one: <samp class="codeph">&lt;!NOTATION myshirt SYSTEM "GIF"&gt;</samp> which
defines a notation for a GIF image.</p>
<p>To create a notation, follow these
steps:</p>
</div>
<ol><li class="skipspace"><span>Open your DTD in the DTD editor.</span></li>
<li class="skipspace"><span>In the Outline view, right-click the DTD <img src="../images/nDTDFile.gif" alt="Image of the DTD icon" /> and select  <span class="uicontrol">Add Notation </span>. </span></li>
<li class="skipspace"><span>In the Properties view, type the name of the notation in the <span class="uicontrol">Name</span> field.</span></li>
<li class="skipspace"><span>(Optional) In the <span class="uicontrol">Public ID</span> field, type
any information you want to supply to the user or application. For example,
a description of what the notation refers to.</span></li>
<li class="skipspace"><span>In the <span class="uicontrol">System ID</span> field, type any information
to be passed along to the application dealing with the binary data. For example,
a URL.</span></li>
<li class="skipspace"><span>Click the <span class="uicontrol">Documentation</span> tab if you want
to provide any information about this notation.</span> The <span class="uicontrol">Documentation</span> page
is used for human readable material, such as a description of the notation
contents.</li>
</ol>
