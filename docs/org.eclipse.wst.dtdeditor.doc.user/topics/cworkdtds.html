A document type definition (DTD) contains a set of rules that can
be used to validate an XML file. After you have created a DTD, you can manually
edit it, adding declarations that define elements, attributes, entities, and
notations, and how they can be used for any XML files that reference the DTD
file.</li>
<li class="ulchildlink"><strong><a href="../topics/timptdtd.html">Importing DTDs</a></strong><br />
If you want to work with DTD files that you created outside of
the product, you can import them into the workbench and open them in the DTD
editor. </li>
<li class="ulchildlink"><strong><a href="../topics/tvaldtd.html">Validating DTDs</a></strong><br />
