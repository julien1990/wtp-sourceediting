<h1 class="topictitle1">Generating XML schemas from DTD files</h1>
<div><p>Generating an XML schema from a DTD file enables you to create
an XML schema that is automatically populated with elements and attributes
from your DTD file. This can save you time if you want to use an XML schema
rather than a DTD file to validate your XML file, but you want to use the
rules already set up in your DTD file.</p><div class="skipspace"><p>The following instructions were written for the Resource perspective,
but they will also work in many other perspectives. </p>
<p>To generate
an XML schema file from a DTD file, follow these steps:</p>
</div>
<ol><li><span>In the Navigator view, right-click your DTD and click <span class="menucascade"><span class="uicontrol">Generate</span> &gt; <span class="uicontrol"> XML Schema</span></span>.</span></li>
<li><span>Select the project or folder that will contain the schema. </span></li>
<li><span>Accept the default name or type a new one and click <span class="uicontrol">Next</span>.</span></li>
<li><span>If you want to create an XML schema that will contain your DTD
file and any DTD files it references, click the <span class="uicontrol">Create one XML
schema that includes all the DTD files</span> radio button.</span></li>
<li><span>Otherwise, if you want to create an individual schema for your
DTD file and each DTD file it references, click the <span class="uicontrol">Create an XML
schema for each DTD file</span> radio button.</span></li>
<li><span>Click  <span class="uicontrol">Finish</span>.</span></li>
</ol>
<div class="skipspace"><p>Your schemas appears in the Navigator view. They will have the
same name as the DTD file they were generated from (if you accepted the default
value in the <span class="uicontrol">File name</span> field when you generated the
XML schema). </p>
<p>Any entities that were in your DTD file will not be in
the XML schema (as entities are not supported in XML schemas). However,
any elements or attributes that referred to an entity will carry over that
value to an XML schema.</p>
</div>
<div class="skipspace"><p>For example, you have a DTD called "Legal" that contains an entity
called "Copyright". The value of the entity is "Copyright 2004. MyCompany
Publishing" . In your DTD, you have an element called "MyCopyright", which
refers to the entity Copyright. After you create the XML schema, the Copyright
entity will not appear in the XML schema, however, its value is carried over
(that is, MyCopyright will have the value: Copyright 2004. MyCompany Publishing
).</p>
<p>All elements and attributes that existed in your DTD file will exist
in the XML schema file.</p>
<p>Elements in your DTD with a content model of
(#PCDATA) (and no attributes) appear empty in the XML schema editor. They
are marked as having <span class="uicontrol">Built-in simple types</span> of <samp class="codeph">string</samp>.
That is, a DTD element with a value of (#PCDATA) will map to an XML schema
element with an XML schema primitive type <samp class="codeph">string</samp>.</p>
<div class="note"><span class="notetitle">Note: </span>When
you generate an XML schema from a DTD file that contains Hebrew or Arabic
elements, certain element names might be encoded with their equivalent hexadecimal
Hebrew and Arabic encoding values. To avoid this problem, change the encoding
attribute of the original DTD or XML schema file to UTF-8 before performing
the generation:  That is, the XML declaration should be: <samp class="codeph">&lt;?xml
version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;</samp> The list of affected encoding values
is:  ISO-8859-8-I, ISO-8859-8,  Windows-1256, and ISO-8859-6.</div>
