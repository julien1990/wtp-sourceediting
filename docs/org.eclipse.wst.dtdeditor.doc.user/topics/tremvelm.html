<h1 class="topictitle1">Deleting elements, attributes, entities, notations, and comments</h1>
<div><p>If you have created elements, attributes, entities, notations,
and comments you no longer need, you can delete any of them. </p><div class="skipspace"><p>The following instructions were written for the Resource perspective,
but they will also work in many other perspectives. </p>
<p>To delete
an element, attribute, entity, notation or comment:</p>
</div>
<ol><li class="skipspace"><span>Open your DTD in the DTD editor.</span></li>
<li class="skipspace"><span>In the Outline view, click the element, attribute, entity, notation,
or comment you want to delete.</span> If you want to delete more
than one item, hold down the<span class="uicontrol">Ctrl</span> key while you select
items.</li>
<li class="skipspace"><span>Right-click the item (or one of the items if you have selected
more than one), and, from its pop-up menu, click <span class="uicontrol">Delete</span>.</span></li>
</ol>
<div class="skipspace"><p>You can "undo" the deletion of an item. To do so, right-click any
element, attribute, entity, notation, or comment and click <span class="uicontrol">Undo
Delete</span>.  You must do this before you close the editor, otherwise,
your items will no longer exist on the system and you will have to recreate
them if you want them again.</p>
<p>The DTD editor has a built-in mechanism
to handle referential integrity issues. When you delete or rename certain
nodes, clean up will automatically occur. </p>
