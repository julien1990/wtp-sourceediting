<h1 class="topictitle1">Validating DTDs</h1>
<div><p>Validating a DTD file lets you verify that it is well formed and
does not contain any errors.</p><div class="skipspace"><p>The following instructions were written for the Resource perspective,
but they will also work in many other perspectives. </p>
<p>To validate
a DTD, follow these steps:</p>
</div>
<div class="p"><span>In the Navigator view, right-click the DTD and click <span class="menucascade"><span class="uicontrol">Validate DTD File</span></span>.</span></div>
<div class="skipspace">A dialog opens, indicating if the DTD file was successfully validated
or not. If the file is invalid, any errors will appear in the Problems view.
 <p><b>Note</b>: If you receive an error message indicating
that the Problems view is full, you can increase the number of error messages
allowed by selecting <span class="menucascade"><span class="uicontrol">Properties</span> &gt; <span class="uicontrol">Validation</span></span> from the project's pop-up menu and specifying the maximum number
of error messages allowed. You might have to select the <span class="uicontrol">Override
validation preferences</span> check box in order to enable the <span class="uicontrol">Maximum
number of validation messages</span> field</p>
<p>You can set up project's
properties so that different types of project resources are automatically
validated when you save them. From a project's pop-up menu select  <span class="uicontrol">Properties</span>,
then select <span class="uicontrol">Validation</span>. Any validators you can run
against your project will be listed in the Validation page. </p>
