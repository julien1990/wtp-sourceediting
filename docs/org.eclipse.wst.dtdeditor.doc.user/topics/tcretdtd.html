<h1 class="topictitle1">Creating DTDs</h1>
<div><p>A document type definition (DTD) contains a set of rules that can
be used to validate an XML file. After you have created a DTD, you can edit
it, adding declarations that define elements, attributes, entities, and notations,
and how they can be used for any XML files that reference the DTD file.</p><div class="skipspace"><p></p>
<p>The following instructions were written for the Resource
perspective, but they will also work in many other perspectives. </p>
<p>Follow
these steps to create a new DTD:</p>
</div>
<ol><li class="skipspace"><span>If necessary, create a project to contain the DTD.</span></li>
<li class="skipspace"><span>In the workbench, select  <span class="menucascade"><span class="uicontrol">File</span> &gt; <span class="uicontrol">New</span> &gt; <span class="uicontrol">Other</span> &gt; <span class="uicontrol">XML</span> &gt; <span class="uicontrol"> DTD</span></span> and click  <span class="uicontrol">Next</span>. </span> If you cannot see the <span class="uicontrol">XML</span> option, select the <span class="uicontrol">Show
All Wizards</span> check box. </li>
<li class="skipspace"><span>If you are prompted to enable XML Development capabilities, click <span class="uicontrol">OK</span>.</span></li>
<li class="skipspace"><span>Select the project or folder that will contain the DTD.</span></li>
<li class="skipspace"><span>In the <span class="uicontrol">File name</span> field, type the name of
the DTD, for example <kbd class="userinput">MyDTD.dtd</kbd>.</span> The
name of your DTD file must end with the extension <kbd class="userinput">.dtd</kbd></li>
<li class="skipspace"><span>Click <span class="uicontrol">Finish</span>.</span></li>
</ol>
<div class="skipspace"><p>The DTD appears in the Navigator view and automatically, by default,
opens in the DTD editor. In the DTD editor, you can add elements, attributes,
notations, entities, and comments to the DTD. If you close the file, and want
to later re-open it in the DTD editor, double-click it in the
Navigator view.</p>
