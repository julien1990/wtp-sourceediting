<h1 class="topictitle1">Limitations of XML Editor</h1>
<div><p>This section describes known product aspect limitations and workarounds.</p><div class="skipspace" id="rlimitations_slushXML__unresolv_URI"><a name="rlimitations_slushXML__unresolv_URI"><!-- --></a><p>The
behavior of the XML parser when encountering an unresolvable URI (for example,
in a DOCTYPE declaration) is to report a fatal IO error and stop any further
processing. An unresolved URI is seen neither as a syntactic nor a semantic
error and as such, the parser does not attempt to handle it. Essentially,
the document remains unchecked. This is a known problem.</p>
