<h1 class="topictitle1">Editing your namespace information</h1>
<div><p>Your namespace information is used to provide various information
about the XML file, such as the XML schema it is associated with. </p><div class="skipspace"><p>The following instructions were written for the Resource perspective,
but they will also work in many other perspectives.</p>
<p>To edit your schema
information, follow these steps:</p>
</div>
<ol><li class="skipspace"><span>In the Design view of the XML editor, right-click
your root element and click <span class="uicontrol">Edit Namespaces</span>.</span></li>
<li class="skipspace"><span>Your XML file may be associated with more than one namespace or
schema.</span> Select the entry you want to edit and click <span class="uicontrol">Edit</span>.</li>
<li class="skipspace"><span>The value in the  <span class="uicontrol">Namespace Name</span> field is
a namespace the XML file is associated with.</span> Your XML file should
be associated with the same namespace(s) its XML schema is associated with.
For more information about namespaces, refer to the related reference.</li>
<li class="skipspace"><span>All qualified elements and attributes in the XML file associated
with the namespace will be prefixed with the  <span class="uicontrol">Prefix</span> value. </span></li>
<li class="skipspace"><span>The <span class="uicontrol">Location Hint</span> field contains the location
of the XML schema the XML file is associated with.</span> An XML Catalog
Key or a namespace name can be specified in this field.  Click <span class="uicontrol">Browse</span> to
view all XML schemas in the workbench and XML Catalog. </li>
<li class="skipspace"><span>Click <span class="uicontrol">OK</span>, then click <span class="uicontrol">OK</span> again.</span></li>
</ol>
<div class="skipspace"><p>If you want to create a new association, click <span class="uicontrol">Add</span> instead
of <span class="uicontrol">Edit</span>. You can then either click the <span class="uicontrol">Specify
From Registered Namespace</span> radio button and select the namespace
declarations you want to add or click the <span class="uicontrol">Specify New Namespace</span> radio
button and fill in the fields as necessary. </p>
