<h1 class="topictitle1">Generating an XML file from an XML schema</h1>
<div><div class="skipspace"><p>You can generate an XML file from an XML schema file. You can
then further customize that file in the XML editor.</p>
<p>Generating an XML
file from an XML schema can be useful if you want to quickly create an XML
file that is based on your XML schema.</p>
<p>The following instructions were
written for the Resource perspective, but they will also work in many other
perspectives.</p>
<p>To generate an XML file from a schema file follow these
steps:</p>
</div>
<ol><li class="skipspace"><span>In the Navigator view, right-click the XML schema file that you
want to work with.</span></li>
<li class="skipspace"><span>From its pop-up menu click <span class="menucascade"><span class="uicontrol">Generate</span> &gt; <span class="uicontrol">XML File</span></span>.</span></li>
<li class="skipspace"><span>Select a project or folder to contain the XML file and type a name
for it.</span> The name of the file must end in<tt class="sysout">.xml.</tt> .</li>
<li class="skipspace"><span>Click  <span class="uicontrol">Next</span>.</span></li>
<li class="skipspace"><span>Click the <span class="uicontrol">Root element</span> of the XML file.</span> The root element of an XML file is the element that contains all other
elements in that file. All of the global elements you have defined in the
XML schema will be included in the Root Element list. If you do not have any
global elements in your XML schema, you cannot create an XML file from it.</li>
<li class="skipspace"><span>Select from the following content options:  </span><ul><li><span class="uicontrol">Create optional attributes</span> - Both mandatory
and optional attributes will be generated</li>
<li><span class="uicontrol">Create optional elements</span> - Both mandatory and
optional elements will be generated.</li>
<li><span class="uicontrol">Create first choice of required choice</span> - 
The first option of a required choice will be generated in your XML file.</li>
<li><span class="uicontrol">Fill elements and attributes with data</span> - any
elements and attributes generated will be filled with sample data.</li>
</ul>
 If you do not select any of these options, then only the minimum amount
of content required for the XML file will be created.</li>
<li class="skipspace"><span>The Namespace information section contains information about the
target namespace of the XML schema, its prefix, and the schema location.</span> For more information about namespaces and namespace prefixes, refer
to the Related reference below. </li>
<li class="skipspace"><span>Select the entry you want to edit and click <span class="uicontrol">Edit</span>. </span></li>
<li class="skipspace"><span>The value in the <span class="uicontrol">Namespace Name</span> field is
the target namespace of the XML schema.</span> Your XML file should be
associated with the same namespace as its XML schema is associated with.</li>
<li class="skipspace"><span>All qualified elements and attributes in the XML file associated
with the namespace will be prefixed with the <span class="uicontrol">Prefix</span> value. </span></li>
<li class="skipspace"><span>The  <span class="uicontrol">Location Hint</span> field contains the location
of the XML schema.</span></li>
<li class="skipspace"><span>Click  <span class="uicontrol">OK</span>, then <span class="uicontrol">Finish</span>.</span></li>
</ol>
<div class="skipspace"><p>The XML file appears in the Navigator view and, by default, automatically
opens in the XML source page editor. The XML source page editor offers limited
functionality compared to the XML editor, so before editing the file, you
should close it, then right-click the file in the Navigator view and click <span class="uicontrol">Open
With &gt; XML Editor</span> to open the file in the XML editor. </p>
<p>To
make the XML editor the default editor for XML files, select <span class="uicontrol">Window
&gt; Preferences &gt; Workbench &gt; File Associations</span>, then select <span class="uicontrol">*.xml</span> and <span class="uicontrol">XML
Editor</span> from the Associated Editors list. Click <span class="uicontrol">OK</span>. </p>
<p>The
XML file will contain the selected root element and any elements or attributes
contained in the root element. It also contains information about the XML
file namespace and location. You can now add elements and attributes to the
XML file.</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> In certain cases, when an XML file is generated
from a complex XML schema file, the XML file may not be valid. If this occurs,
you can open the generated file in the XML editor and correct any errors that
occur. Usually, only a few errors need to be fixed. The following XML schema
constructs may present problems:</p>
<ol><li>Restrictions. Sometimes restricted elements are erroneously generated. </li>
<li>Facets: Default generated data values may not conform to complex facets
(for example, patterns).</li>
<li> Abstract elements. abstract elements are sometimes erroneously generated.</li>
</ol>
