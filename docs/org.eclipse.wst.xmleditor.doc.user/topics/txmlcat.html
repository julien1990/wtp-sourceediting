<h1 class="topictitle1">Adding entries to the XML Catalog</h1>




<div><p>An XML Catalog entry contains two parts - a Key (which represents
a DTD or XML schema) and a Location (similar to a URI, which contains information
about a DTD or XML schema's location). You can place the Key in an XML file.
When the XML processor encounters it, it will use the XML Catalog entry to
find the location of the DTD or XML schema associated with the Key</p>

<div class="section"><p>XML Catalog entries can be used in various situations. For example,
you are working on an XML file on your main desktop computer and point its <samp class="codeph">schemaLocation</samp> towards
a schema called <samp class="codeph">c:\MySchema.xsd</samp>. You then save it to your
laptop computer so you can work on it later. When you open the file on your
laptop, however, you encounter a problem - the XML editor cannot find the <samp class="codeph">MySchema.xsd</samp> schema
because it is actually installed on your D drive. You will have to edit the <samp class="codeph">schemaLocation</samp> to
point to <samp class="codeph">d:\MySchema.xsd</samp>. When you have finished editing
the XML file and are ready to publish it on the Web, you will need to edit
the URI again so that it points to a resource that is accessible on the Web.
By now, the problem is obvious. A URI used within an XML file is not as portable
as you would like it to be. To avoid making frequent changes to your XML document,
you can use the XML Catalog.</p>
<p>An XML Catalog entry is used by an XML
processor when resolving entity references. You can provide rules to the catalog
to specify how entities should be resolved. If you consider the preceding
example, you could specify a rule that redirects an Internet resource reference
(for example,  <samp class="codeph">"http://www.ibm.com/published-schemas/MySchema.xsd"</samp>)
so that it points to a resource on the developer's local machine (for example,
 <samp class="codeph">"file:///C:/MySchema.xsd"</samp>). Now, instead of frequently editing
XML documents to update the URIs or locations (especially when there are many
documents in your project), you only need to update a single rule in your
XML Catalog.</p>
<p>The following instructions were written for the Resource
perspective, but they will also work in many other perspectives.</p>
<p>To
add an entry to the XML Catalog, follow these steps:</p>
</div>

<ol>
<li class="stepexpand"><span>Open the XML file that you want to associate with a DTD or XML
schema.</span></li>

<li class="stepexpand"><span>Click  <span class="menucascade"><span class="uicontrol">Window</span> &gt; <span class="uicontrol">Preferences</span>
</span> and select <span class="menucascade"><span class="uicontrol">XML</span> &gt; <span class="uicontrol">XML
Catalog</span></span>.</span> The  <span class="uicontrol">XML Catalog
Entries</span> section contains a list of any user-defined and plug-in
defined catalog entries. Select any entry to see information about it in the <span class="uicontrol">Details</span> section.
</li>

<li class="stepexpand"><span>Click <span class="uicontrol">Add</span> to create a new catalog entry.</span>
</li>

<li class="stepexpand"><span>In the <span class="uicontrol">Location</span> field, enter or browse for
the location or URI of the DTD or XML schema file. This uses your computer's
path style to describe the location of the file.</span></li>

<li class="stepexpand"><span>Select a key type for the catalog entry from the <span class="uicontrol">Key
Type</span> drop down.</span> The values in this list will change
depending on the type of file you specified in the <span class="uicontrol">Location</span> field:<ul>
<li>If you specified a DTD: select <span class="uicontrol">Public ID</span>, <span class="uicontrol">System
ID</span>, or <span class="uicontrol">URI</span> from the <span class="uicontrol">Key Type</span> field.
If you select <span class="uicontrol">Public ID,</span> the value you enter in the <span class="uicontrol">Key</span> field
should be the same as the Public ID in the XML file's DOCTYPE declaration.
If you select <span class="uicontrol">System ID</span>, the value you enter should
correspond to the System ID in an XML file's DOCTYPE declaration. If you select <span class="uicontrol">URI</span>,
the value you enter must be a fully qualified URI.</li>

<li>If you specified an XML schema: select either <span class="uicontrol">Namespace Name</span> or
 <span class="uicontrol">Schema Location</span> from the <span class="uicontrol">Key Type</span> field.
If the schema defines a target namespace, it will automatically appear in
the <span class="uicontrol">Key</span> field. Otherwise, you can enter the schema
location in the <span class="uicontrol">Key</span> field.</li>

</ul>
</li>

<li class="stepexpand"><span>Select the <span class="uicontrol">Specify alternative Web address</span> check
box if you want to be able to specify an alternate Web address for the resource.</span>
 This Web address is used when an XML instance is generated from this
catalog entry.<div class="note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> This option is only available if you select <span class="uicontrol">Public
ID</span> (for a DTD) or  <span class="uicontrol">Namespace Name</span> (for
a schema) in the  <span class="uicontrol">Key type</span> field.</div>
</li>

<li class="stepexpand"><span>If you want to refer to another catalog without importing it into
the workbench, click <span class="uicontrol">Next Catalog</span>. Type or browse for
the XML catalog you want to refer to. </span></li>

<li class="stepexpand"><span>When you are done creating catalog entries, click <span class="uicontrol">OK</span> to
close the Add XML Catalog Entry dialog. Click <span class="uicontrol">OK</span> again
to save your settings.</span></li>

<li class="stepexpand"><span>Make sure the XML file is in focus and click the <span class="uicontrol">Reload
dependencies</span> toolbar button. </span></li>

</ol>

<div class="section">The XML file is now associated with the latest version of the XML
schema or DTD.</div>

<div class="section"><p>You can also export and import XML Catalog information: </p>
<p>To
export, click <span class="uicontrol">File &gt; Export</span> and select <span class="uicontrol">XML
&gt; XML Catalog</span>. You will be prompted to select a project and provide
a file name to store your catalog entries in an .xmlcatalog file, which can
be opened from the Navigator view. Since your catalog entries are stored in
an .xmlcatalog file, you can check them in and out and share them like any
other project resource.</p>
<p>To import, click <span class="uicontrol">File &gt; Import</span> and
select <span class="uicontrol">XML &gt; XML Catalog</span>. Then specify the file that
will be used to load the XML Catalog settings. When you import a .xmlcatalog
file, any entries in it will be loaded into the XML Catalog (and any existing
entries will be overwritten). </p>
