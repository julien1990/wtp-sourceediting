<h1 class="topictitle1">Adding an entry to the XML Catalog</h1>
<div><div class="skipspace"><p>An XML Catalog entry contains two parts - a Key (which represents
a DTD or XML schema) and a URI (which contains information about a DTD or
XML schema's location).  You can place the Key in an XML file. When the
XML processor encounters it, it will use the XML Catalog entry to find the
location of the DTD or XML schema associated with the Key.   </p>
<p>XML
Catalog entries can be used in various situations. For example, you are working
on an XML file on your main desktop computer and point its <samp class="codeph">schemaLocation</samp> towards
a schema called <samp class="codeph">c:\MySchema.xsd</samp>. You then save it to your
laptop computer so you can work on it later. When you open the file on your
laptop, however, you encounter a problem - the XML editor cannot find the <samp class="codeph">MySchema.xsd</samp> schema because
it is actually installed on your D drive. You will have to edit the  <samp class="codeph">schemaLocation</samp>to
point to <samp class="codeph">d:\MySchema.xsd</samp>. When you have finished editing
the XML file and are ready to publish it on the Web, you will need to edit
the URI again so that it points to a resource that is accessible on the Web.
By now, the problem is obvious. A URI used within an XML file is not as portable
as you would like it to be. To avoid making frequent changes to your XML document,
you can use the XML Catalog.</p>
<p>An XML Catalog entry is used by an XML
processor when resolving entity references. You can provide rules to the catalog
to specify how entities should be resolved. If you consider the example above,
you could specify a rule that redirects an Internet resource reference (for
example,  <samp class="codeph">"http://www.ibm.com/published-schemas/MySchema.xsd"</samp>)
so that it points to a resource on the developer's local machine (for example,
 <samp class="codeph">"file:///C:/MySchema.xsd"</samp>). Now, instead of frequently editing
XML documents to update the URIs (especially when there may be many documents
in your project), you only need to update a single rule in your XML Catalog.</p>
<p>More
information on XML Catalog entries is included in the sample  <a href="aexpledt.html">Exploring
the XML editor</a>.</p>
<p>The following instructions were written for the
XML perspective, but they will also work in many other perspectives.</p>
<p>To
add an entry to the XML Catalog, follow these steps:</p>
</div>
<ol><li class="skipspace"><span>Open the XML file that you want to associate with a DTD or XML
schema.</span></li>
<li class="skipspace"><span>Click  <span class="menucascade"><span class="uicontrol">Window</span> &gt; <span class="uicontrol">Preferences</span> &gt; <span class="uicontrol">Web and XML</span> &gt; <span class="uicontrol">XML Catalog</span></span>.</span></li>
<li class="skipspace"><span>The  <span class="uicontrol">XML Catalog Entries</span> field contains
a list of any user-defined and plug-in defined catalog entries.</span><ol type="a"><li><span>Select any entry to see details about it in the <span class="uicontrol">Details</span> field. </span></li>
<li><span>Click <span class="uicontrol">New</span> to create a new catalog entry.</span></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li class="skipspace"><span>In the <span class="uicontrol">URI</span> field, type the location of the
DTD or XML schema. You can only browse for the DTD or XML schema if it
is located in the workbench.</span></li>
<li class="skipspace"><span>If you specified a DTD in the <span class="uicontrol">URI</span> field,
you can select either <span class="uicontrol">Public ID</span> or <span class="uicontrol">System
ID</span> from the <span class="uicontrol">Key Type</span> field.</span> If
you select<span class="uicontrol">Public ID,</span> the value you enter in the <span class="uicontrol">Key</span> field
should be the same as the Public ID in the XML file's DOCTYPE declaration.
If you select <span class="uicontrol">System ID</span>, the value you enter should
correspond to the System ID in an XML file's DOCTYPE declaration.</li>
<li class="skipspace"><span>If you specified an XML schema in the <span class="uicontrol">URI</span> field,
you can select either <span class="uicontrol">Namespace Name</span> or  <span class="uicontrol">Schema
Location</span> from the <span class="uicontrol">Key Type</span> field.</span> If the schema defines a target namespace, it will automatically appear
in the<span class="uicontrol">Key</span> field. Otherwise, you can enter the schema
location in the <span class="uicontrol">Key</span> field.</li>
<li class="skipspace"><span>Select the <span class="uicontrol">Specify alternative Web address</span> check
box if you want to be able to specify an alternate Web address for the resource.</span> This Web address is used when an XML instance is generated from this
catalog entry.   <b>Note</b>: This option is only available if you select <span class="uicontrol">Public
ID</span> (for a DTD) or  <span class="uicontrol">Namespace Name</span> (for
a schema) in the  <span class="uicontrol">Key type</span> field.</li>
<li class="skipspace"><span>Click  <span class="uicontrol">OK</span>.</span></li>
<li class="skipspace"><span>Click  <span class="uicontrol">Advanced</span> if you want to import or
export any XML Catalog settings.</span></li>
<li class="skipspace"><span>Click  <span class="uicontrol">Export</span> if you want to persist the
XML Catalog information. Only your user specified entries will be exported.</span><ol type="a"><li class="skipspace"><span>You will be prompted to select a project and provide a file
name to store your catalog entries in an .xmlcatalog file, which can be opened
from the Navigator view.</span> Snce your catalog entries are stored in
an .xmlcatalog file, you can check them in and out and share them like any
other project resource.</li>
<li class="skipspace"><span> Click<span class="uicontrol">OK</span>.</span></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li class="skipspace"><span>Click  <span class="uicontrol">Import</span> if you want to import an .xmlcatalog
file.  You will be prompted to select the file you want to import.</span><ol type="a"><li><span>When you import a .xmlcatalog file, any entries in it will be
loaded into the XML Catalog (and any existing entries will be overwritten). </span></li>
<li><span>Click <span class="uicontrol">OK</span>.</span></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li class="skipspace"><span>Click <span class="uicontrol">OK</span> to close the Advanced XML Catalog
Preferences dialog.</span></li>
<li class="skipspace"><span>Make sure the XML file is in focus and click the<span class="uicontrol">Reload
dependencies</span> toolbar button. </span></li>
