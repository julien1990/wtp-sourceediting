<h1 class="topictitle1">Updating XML files with changes made to DTDs and schemas</h1>
<div><p>If you make changes to a DTD file or XML schema associated with
an XML file (that is currently open), click <span class="uicontrol">XML &gt; Reload Dependencies</span> to
update the XML file with these changes.</p><div class="skipspace"><p>The changes will be reflected in the guided editing mechanisms
available in the editor, such as content assist.</p>
<p>For example, you have
a DTD file called "Contact.dtd" and an XML file called "Contact.xml" associated
with it. Contact.dtd contains a root element called  <span class="uicontrol">Contact</span> that
can contain any of the following children elements:  <span class="uicontrol">Name</span>,
 <span class="uicontrol">PostalAddress</span>,  <span class="uicontrol">Email</span>. If you
remove the child element  <span class="uicontrol">Email</span> from the DTD, you will
no longer be able to add an  <span class="uicontrol">Email</span> child element to
your root element Contact in your Contact.xml file. This change, however,
will not come into effect until you save your changes in the DTD and click <span class="uicontrol">XML
&gt; Reload Dependencies</span> in the XML editor. Until you click it, you
will still be able to add <span class="uicontrol">Email</span> elements to Contact.xml.</p>
<p>This
feature is very handy when you are making updates to both DTDs and XML schemas
and XML files that are associated with DTDs and XML schemas.</p>
