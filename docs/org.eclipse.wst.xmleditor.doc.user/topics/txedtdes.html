<h1 class="topictitle1">Editing in the Design view</h1>
<div><p>The XML editor has a Design view, which represents the XML file
simultaneously as a table and a tree. This helps make navigation and editing
easier. Content and attribute values can be edited directly in the table cells,
while pop-up menus on the tree elements give alternatives that are valid for
that particular element.</p><div class="skipspace"><p> For example, the <span class="uicontrol">Add child</span> menu item will
list only those elements from a DTD or XML schema which would be valid children
at that point.</p>
<p>When you have an XML file associated with an XML schema
or DTD file, certain tags and rules for that file have already been established,
which is why the Design view can provide prompts (via a pop-up menu) for those
tags. When you create an XML file that is not associated with an XML schema
or DTD file, it has no tags or rules associated with it, so the Design view
cannot provide prompts for specific tags, but it can provide prompts to create
new elements and attributes.</p>
<p>For any XML file associated with an XML
schema or DTD file, you can use the Design view to add any items defined in
the XML schema or DTD (such as elements and attributes) to the XML file. You
can also use it to add processing instructions and comments to all XML files. </p>
<p>For
more information on the icons used in the Design view, refer to the related
reference.</p>
<p>The following instructions were written for the Resource
perspective, but they will also work in many other perspectives.</p>
<p>To
edit an XML file in the Design view, follow these steps:</p>
</div>
<ol><li class="skipspace"><span>Open the XML file that you want to work with in the XML editor
(right-click the file in the Navigator view and click <span class="uicontrol">Open With
&gt; XML Editor</span>). If necessary, click the <span class="uicontrol">Design</span> tab.</span></li>
<li class="skipspace"><span>To expand all the items in your XML file, click the <span class="uicontrol">Expand
All</span> toolbar button  <img src="../images/expand_all.gif" />.</span></li>
<li class="skipspace"><span>To collapse them, click the <span class="uicontrol">Collapse All</span> toolbar
button  <img src="../images/collapse_all.gif" />.</span></li>
<li class="skipspace"><span>Right-click the item that you want to work with.</span> Some
or all of the following options (as applicable) will be available from the
pop-up menu that appears. For more information on these options, refer to
the related tasks:<ul><li> <span class="uicontrol">Add DTD Information</span> - Click this if you want to
associate the XML file with a DTD</li>
<li> <span class="uicontrol">Edit DOCTYPE</span> - Click this if you want to edit
the DOCTYPE declaration.</li>
<li> <span class="uicontrol">Edit Namespaces</span> - Click this if you want to edit
the existing namespace information or create a new association with a namespace.</li>
<li> <span class="uicontrol">Edit Processing Instruction</span> - Click this if you
want to edit the processing instruction.</li>
<li> <span class="uicontrol">Remove</span> - Click this if you want to remove the
item that you have selected from the XML file. This option will not be available
if the item you want to remove must exist (for example, in your DTD, you have
declared that "One or more" of the item must always exist in your XML file,
and the item you have selected is the only one that exists in your XML file).</li>
<li> <span class="uicontrol">Add Attribute</span> - Click this if you want to add
an attribute to the element that you selected. Any attributes you are allowed
to add to the element will be listed. After you have added the attribute to
the XML file, you can click in the right-hand column to change the value of
the attribute. If the attribute has set values, they will appear in a list. </li>
<li> <span class="uicontrol">Add Child</span> - Click this to add another element,
a comment, or a processing instruction as a child of the parent element.</li>
<li> <span class="uicontrol">Add Before</span>  - Click this to add a child element,
comment, or processing instruction that can go before the item you have selected.
For example, if you have a parent element called "CD Collections" that can
contain an unlimited amount of children called "CD", you could click a CD
element and click <span class="menucascade"><span class="uicontrol">Add Before</span> &gt; <span class="uicontrol"> CD</span></span> , as a CD element can go before another CD element.</li>
<li> <span class="uicontrol">Add After</span> - Click this to add a child element,
comment, or processing instruction that can go after the item you have selected.
For example, if you have a parent element called "CD Collections" that can
contain an unlimited amount of children called "CD", you could click a CD
element and click  <span class="menucascade"><span class="uicontrol">Add After</span> &gt; <span class="uicontrol"> CD</span></span>, as a CD element can go after another CD element.</li>
<li> <span class="uicontrol">Replace With</span> - Click this if you want to replace
one item with another. This option is not available if you turn grammar constraints
off or if there are no valid alternatives for you to replace the item with.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="skipspace"><span>Click the appropriate option.</span></li>
</ol>
<div class="skipspace"><p>Any changes you make in the Design view are also reflected in the
Source view and the Outline view.</p>
