		The XSL Preference pages has several sub sections.  Each of these allow for configuration
		of various aspects of the preferences.   From the controlling of the default XSL processor
		to be used during transformations.   To extending the content assist support of the XPath
		functions available in the XML editor.

   			The XSL Features preference page allows for the configuration of features for a particular
   			processor.   XSL Tooling comes with Xalan 2.7.0 by default.  Adopters can extend and include
   			their own specific features for their own procesoors.   An adopter could extend the tooling
   			to support XSLT 2.0 transformations, and features particular to that parser.

   			The <span class="bold"><strong>Processor Type</strong></span> allows you to set features for a specific processor.  In this case
   			this is for the processor that is being installed.   XSL Tooling comes with Xalan 2.7.0, and it is the only available
   			processor type by default.
   		</p><p>
   		    The feature table lists the features that are specific to the processor that was selected.  As you
   		    select each of the features, information regarding that feature and it's abilitis is displayed in the
   		    description box.   By clicking in the value column, next to the feature you want to set the value
   		    for, the user can set the feature.
