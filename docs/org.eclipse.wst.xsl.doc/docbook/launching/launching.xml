		<title>XSLT Debugging</title>
		<para>
	   		XSL Tools provides a framework for XSLT processors to provide debugging support.  The support
            provided is highly dependent on the processors.   XSL Tools comes with built in support
            for the Xalan 2.7.1 processor.   Debugging is only available for those processors that
            support the feature and plug into the extension point.

            <title>Result View</title>
            <para>
               The XSLT Debugger has a result view.  This will show the output that the
               stylesheet has generated to the current break point or since the last step command was issued.
