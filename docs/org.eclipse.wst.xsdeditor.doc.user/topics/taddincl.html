<h1 class="topictitle1">Adding include elements</h1>
<div><p>As schemas become larger, it is often desirable to divide their content 
	among several schema documents for purposes such as ease of maintenance, 
	reuse, and readability. You can use the <samp class="codeph">include</samp> 
	element to brings in definitions and declarations from the included schema 
	into the current schema. The included schema must be in the same target 
	namespace as the including schema. </p><div class="skipspace">
<p>The following instructions were written for the XML perspective, but they 
will also work in many other perspectives.</p>
<p>To
add an include element , follow these steps:</p>
</div>
<ol><li class="skipspace"><span>Open your XML schema in the XML schema editor.</span></li>
<li class="skipspace"><span>In the Outline view, select your schema.</span> The entire
schema and its contents should be displayed in the Graph view.</li>
<li class="skipspace"><span>In the Graph view, right click in the <b>Directives</b> section
and click <b> <span class="uicontrol">Add Include</span>.</b></span></li>
<li class="skipspace"><span>In the Properties view, click the <b>General</b> tab and click
the <b> <span class="uicontrol">More</span></b> button
<img border="0" src="../images/More.gif" width="22" height="18"> to the right of the
<b> <span class="uicontrol">Schema
location</span> </b>field.</span> The XML schema file you select must
have the same namespace as the current schema.</li>
<li class="skipspace"><span>If you want to select an XML schema located in the
workbench, select the <b> <span class="uicontrol">Workbench projects</span></b> radio button
and click <b> <span class="uicontrol">Next</span></b>. </span><ol type="a"><li><span>Select the schema you want to include and click 
	<b> <span class="uicontrol">Finish</span></b>.</span></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li class="skipspace"><span>If you want to select an XML schema located on the Web, select
the <b> <span class="uicontrol">HTTP</span></b> radio button and click <b> <span class="uicontrol">Next</span></b>.</span><ol type="a"><li><span>Type the URL of the XML schema and click 
	<b> <span class="uicontrol">Finish</span></b>. </span></li>
</ol>
 <div class="note"><span class="notetitle"><b>Note</b>: </span> A local copy of the schema will not be stored in the workbench.
Every time you validate your schema, the schema's contents will be checked
from the URL you specify.</div>
</li>
<li class="skipspace"><span>The XML schema editor will retrieve the location of the included
XML schema file and display it as read-only in the <b> <span class="uicontrol">Schema location</span></b> field.</span></li>
<li class="skipspace"><span>Click the <b> <span class="uicontrol">Documentation</span></b> tab if you want
to provide any information about this include element.</span> The <span class="uicontrol">Documentation</span> page
is used for human readable material, such as a description, and the <span class="uicontrol">App
Info</span> page can be used to provide information for applications.</li>
</ol>
<div class="skipspace"><p>Once you have added the include element to your XML schema, when
you define new elements, attributes, complex types, or simple types where
you can specify type information, any declarations from the included schema
will be available in the <span class="uicontrol">Type</span> list for the element,
attribute, complex or simple type.</p>
<p>For example, if Address.xsd has the
following content:</p>
<pre>&lt;complexType name="Address"&gt;
    &lt;sequence&gt;
        &lt;element name="name" type="string"&gt;
        &lt;element name="street" type="string"&gt;
    &lt;/sequence&gt;
&lt;/complexType&gt;</pre>
and you have an XML schema called PurchaseOrder.xsd that has added
an include for Address.xsd, then when defining a new element in  PurchaseOrder,
you can select Address as its type.  <p>(c) Copyright 2001, World Wide Web

<a href="../topics/taddimpt.html" title="As schemas become larger, it is often desirable to divide their content among several schema documents for purposes such as ease of maintenance, reuse, and readability. XML schema defines two constructs to support this: include and import. The include element brings in definitions and declarations from the included schema into the current schema. It requires the included schema to be in the same target namespace as the including schema. The import element behaves in a similar way, with the exception that the imported schema can come from a different namespace.">Adding an import element</a><br />
<a href="../topics/taddrdfn.html" title="You can use the redefine mechanism to redefine simple and complex types, groups, and attribute groups obtained from external schema files. Like the include mechanism, redefine requires the external components to be in the same target namespace as the redefining schema, although external components from schemas that have no namespace can also be redefined.">Adding a redefine element</a><br />
