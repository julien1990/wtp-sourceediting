<shortdesc>As schemas become larger, it is often desirable to divide their
content among several schema documents for purposes such as ease of maintenance,
reuse, and readability. You can use the <codeph>include</codeph> element to
bring<?Pub Caret?> in definitions and declarations from the included schema
into the current schema. The included schema must be in the same target namespace
as the including schema. </shortdesc>

<context><p>The following instructions were written for the XML perspective,
but they will also work in many other perspectives.</p><p>To add an include
element, follow these steps:</p></context>
<steps>
<step><cmd>Open your XML schema in the XML schema editor.</cmd></step>
<step><cmd>In the Outline view, select your schema.</cmd><info>The entire
schema and its contents are displayed in the Design view.</info></step>
<step><cmd>In the Design view, right-click in the <b>Directives</b> section
and click <uicontrol>Add Include</uicontrol>.</cmd></step>
<step><cmd>In the Properties view, click the <b>General</b> tab and click <uicontrol>Browse</uicontrol> <image
href="../images/Browse.gif"><alt>This graphic is the Browse button</alt></image> to
the right of the <uicontrol>Schema location</uicontrol> field.</cmd><info>The
XML schema file you select must have the same namespace as the current schema.</info>
</step>
<step><cmd>If you want to select an XML schema located in the workbench, select <uicontrol>Workbench
projects</uicontrol> and click <uicontrol>Next</uicontrol>. </cmd></step>
<step><cmd>Select the schema you want to include and click <uicontrol>Finish</uicontrol>.</cmd>
</step>
<step><cmd>If you want to select an XML schema located on the Web, select <uicontrol>HTTP</uicontrol> and
click <uicontrol>Next</uicontrol>.</cmd></step>
<step><cmd>Type the URL of the XML schema and click <uicontrol>Finish</uicontrol>.</cmd>
<info><note> A local copy of the schema will not be stored in the workbench.
Every time you validate your schema, the schema's contents will be checked
from the URL you specify.</note></info></step>
<step><cmd>The XML schema editor will retrieve the location of the included
XML schema file, and display it in the <uicontrol>Schema location</uicontrol> field.
This field can be edited at any time to reflect the location of the XML schema
file.</cmd></step>
<step><cmd>Click the <uicontrol>Documentation</uicontrol> tab if you want
to provide any information about this include element.</cmd><info>The <uicontrol>Documentation</uicontrol> page
is used for human readable material, such as a description.</info></step>
<step><cmd>Click the <uicontrol>Extensions</uicontrol> tab if you want to
add application information elements to your annotations of schema components.</cmd>
<info>The <uicontrol>Extensions</uicontrol> page allows you to specify the
schema and add XML content to your annotations.</info></step>
</steps>
<result><p>Once you have added the include element to your XML schema, when
you define new elements, attributes, complex types, or simple types where
you can specify type information, any declarations from the included schema
will be available in the <uicontrol>Type</uicontrol> list for the element,
attribute, complex or simple type.</p><p>For example, if Address.xsd has the
following content:</p><codeblock>&lt;complexType name="Address">
    &lt;sequence>
        &lt;element name="name" type="string">
        &lt;element name="street" type="string">
    &lt;/sequence>
&lt;/complexType>
</codeblock>and you have an XML schema called PurchaseOrder.xsd that has added
an include for Address.xsd, then when defining a new element in  PurchaseOrder,
you can select Address as its type.  <p>(c) Copyright 2001, World Wide Web
