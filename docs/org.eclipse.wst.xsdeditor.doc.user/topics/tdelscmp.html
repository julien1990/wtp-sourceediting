<h1 class="topictitle1">Deleting XML schema components</h1>
<div><p>If you have created any XML schema components you no longer need,
you can delete them.</p>
<div class="section"><p>The following instructions were written for the Resource perspective,
but they will also work in many other perspectives.</p>
<p>To delete
an XML schema component, follow these steps:</p>
</div>
<ol><li><span>Open your XML schema in the XML schema editor.</span></li>
<li><span>In the Outline view, click the item to delete.</span></li>
<li><span>Right-click the item, and, from its pop-up menu, click <b> <span class="uicontrol">Delete</span></b>.</span></li>
</ol>
<div class="skipspace"><p>The XML schema editor has a built-in mechanism to 
	handle referential integrity issues. When you delete certain components, 
	cleanup will automatically occur. </p>
