<h1 class="topictitle1">Adding a group reference</h1>
<div><p>A group reference is a declaration that references
a group. It enables the referenced group to appear in the instance document
in the context of the referencing declaration. </p><div class="skipspace">The menu option to add a group reference only appears if there are
groups defined elsewhere in the document.<p>The following instructions were
written for the Resource perspective, but they will also work in many other
perspectives. </p>
<p>To add a group reference, follow these steps:</p>
</div>
<ol><li class="skipspace"><span>In the Outline view, right-click the content model you want to
work with and select <span class="uicontrol">Add Group Ref</span>.</span></li>
<li class="skipspace"><span>Select the new group reference.</span></li>
<li class="skipspace"><span>In the Properties view, select the group you want to refer to in
the <span class="uicontrol">ref</span> list.</span></li>
<li class="skipspace"><span>Click the <span class="uicontrol">Documentation</span> tab if you want
to provide any information about this group reference.</span> The <span class="uicontrol">Documentation</span> page
is used for human readable material, such as a description, and the <span class="uicontrol">App
Info</span> page can be used to provide information for applications. </li>
