<h1 class="topictitle1">Adding redefine elements</h1>




<div><p>You can use the <samp class="codeph">redefine</samp> mechanism to redefine
simple and complex types, groups, and attribute groups obtained from external
schema files. When you redefine a component, you are modifying its contents.</p>

<div class="section"><p>Like the <samp class="codeph">include</samp> mechanism, <samp class="codeph">redefine</samp> requires
the external components to be in the same target namespace as the redefining
schema, although external components from schemas that have no namespace can
also be redefined.</p>
<p>The following instructions were written for the Resource
perspective, but they will also work in many other perspectives.</p>
<p>To
add a redefine element , follow these steps:</p>
</div>

<ol>
<li class="stepexpand"><span>Open your XML schema in the XML schema editor.</span></li>

<li class="stepexpand"><span>In the Outline view, select your schema.</span> The entire
schema and its contents should be displayed in the Graph view.</li>

<li class="stepexpand"><span>In the Graph view, right-click in the <strong>Directives</strong> section
and click <span class="uicontrol">Add Redefine</span>.</span></li>

<li class="stepexpand"><span>In the Properties view, click the <strong>General</strong> tab and click
the <span class="uicontrol">Browse</span> <img src="../images/Browse.gif" alt="This&#10;graphic is the Browse button" /> button to the right of the <span class="uicontrol">Schema
location</span> field.</span> The XML schema file you select must
have the same namespace as the current schema.</li>

<li class="stepexpand"><span>If you want to select an XML schema located in the workbench, select
the <span class="uicontrol">Workbench projects</span> radio button and click <span class="uicontrol">Next.</span></span>
<ol type="a">
<li><span> Select the schema you want to include and click <span class="uicontrol">Finish</span>.</span>
</li>

</ol>

</li>

<li class="stepexpand"><span>If you want to select an XML schema located on the Web, select
the <span class="uicontrol">HTTP</span> radio button and click <span class="uicontrol">Next</span>.</span>
<ol type="a">
<li><span>Type the URL of the XML schema and click <span class="uicontrol">Finish</span>.
 </span></li>

</ol>

  <div class="note"><span class="notetitle">Note: </span>A local copy of the schema will not be stored in the workbench.
Every time you validate your schema, the schema's contents will be checked
from the URL you specify.</div>
</li>

<li class="stepexpand"><span>The XML schema editor will retrieve the location of the included
XML schema file, and display it in the <span class="uicontrol">Schema location</span> field.
This field can be edited at any time to reflect the location of the XML schema
file.</span></li>

<li class="stepexpand"><span>Click the <span class="uicontrol">Documentation</span> tab if you want
to provide any information about this redefine element.</span> The <span class="uicontrol">Documentation</span> page
is used for human readable material, such as a description, and the <span class="uicontrol">App
Info</span> page can be used to provide information for applications.
</li>

</ol>

<div class="section"><p>Once you have added the redefine element to your XML schema, you
can redefine any of the simple and complex types, groups, and attribute groups
in the XML schema you selected in the redefine element. </p>
</div>
