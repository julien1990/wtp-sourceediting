			If you want to work with XML schema files that you created outside 
			of the product, you can import them into the workbench and open them 
			in the XML schema editor. The XML schema editor provides you with a 
			structured view of the XML schema.</div>
	</div>
	<div class="skipspace"><p>The following instructions were written for the 
		Resource perspective, but they will also work in many other 
		perspectives.</p>
<p>To import
an XML schema into the workbench, follow these steps:</p>
</div>
<ol><li class="skipspace"><span>Click  <b>  <span class="menucascade"><span class="uicontrol">File &gt; Import</span></span></b>.</span></li>
<li class="skipspace"><span>Select the import source.</span>  Click <b> <span class="uicontrol">Next</span></b>.</li>
<li class="skipspace"><span>Fill in the fields in the Import wizard as necessary.</span>  When
you are finished, click <b> <span class="uicontrol">Finish</span></b>.</li>
</ol>
<div class="skipspace"><p>The imported schema now appears in the Navigator view. Double-click
it to open it in the XML schema editor.</p>

XML schema defines two constructs to support this: include and import. The include element brings in definitions and declarations from the included schema into the current schema. It requires the included schema to be in the same target namespace as the including schema. The import element behaves in a similar way, with the exception that the imported schema can come from a different namespace.">Adding an import element</a><br />
