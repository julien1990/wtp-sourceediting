<h1>Web Tools Project Limitations and Known Issues</h1>
<p>The following are limitations and known issues:</p>
<dl>
<dt class="dlterm"><b>When using XDoclet the generation does not appear to run.</b></dt>
<dd><p>Cause: XDoclet has some limitations with long path names.</p>
<p>Solution: You should install Eclipse and the Web Tools Platform into a directory with a short
path.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="dlterm"><b>When creating a Web service you may see a message similar to the following one:</b></dt>
<dd><p><samp>org.apache.axis.utils.JavaUtils isAttachmentSupported
WARNING: Unable to find required classes (javax.activation.DataHandler and 
javax.mail.internet.MimeMultipart). Attachment support is disabled.
</samp></p>
<p>Cause: Attachment support is disabled.</p>
<p>Solution: The Apache Axis tools should auto-detect the javax.activation classes provided you add 
<samp>activation.jar</samp> to the build path of the project to which you are generating your Web service or client. 
For services, you will also need to make sure <samp>activation.jar</samp> is available to the Tomcat JRE, either by 
including it in the server's global classpath or by placing a copy of activation.jar into the target Web 
project's <samp>lib/</samp> directory.
