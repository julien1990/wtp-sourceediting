<h1 class="topictitle1">Snippets view</h1>
<div><p>This documentation gives an overview of the Snippets view.</p><p>The Snippets view lets you catalog and organize reusable programming objects,
such as HTML tagging, JavaScript™, and JSP code, along with files
and custom JSP tags. The view can be extended based on additional objects
that you define and include.</p>
<p>To view or collapse the objects in a specific drawer, click the drawer
name.</p>
<div class="p">The Snippets view has the following features: <ul><li>Drag-and-drop to various source editing pages: You can drag items from
the view into the active editor and the text will be dropped into the document
at the cursor location </li>
<li>Double-click support: You can double-click on an item and have it inserted
at the current cursor position in the active editor </li>
<li>User-defined drawers and items: You can define, edit, and remove items
from view drawers as desired.</li>
<li>Plug-in-defined drawers and items: Plug-in developers can contribute a
default list of items to their own drawers.</li>
<li>Variables in insertions: By default, items will be edited using a dialog
and, when inserted, you will be prompted for values for each of the variables.</li>
<li>Customization: You can select which drawers and items are shown in the
Snippets view.</li>
<li>Custom insertion: Plug-in developers can customize the behavior of items
so that when they are dropped during a drag-and-drop action, both the text
that is inserted and the insertion location are strictly defined.</li>
</ul>
