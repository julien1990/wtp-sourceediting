<h1 class="topictitle1">Making content assist work for JSP files</h1>
<div><p>Having the proper files defined in the Java™ build class path is essential for
content assist to work properly in JSP files. It is also essential for the
links builder to be able to correctly resolve links to servlets or Java beans
in JSP and HTML files.</p><div class="skipspace">To make content assist work for JSP files:</div>
<ol><li class="skipspace"><span>To determine whether the build path is correct, select <span class="uicontrol">Properties</span> from
the project's pop-up menu. </span></li>
<li class="skipspace"><span>Select <span class="uicontrol">Java Build Path</span>, and then the <span class="uicontrol">Libraries</span> page. </span> You should see the following files:<ul><li>j2ee.jar</li>
<li>rt.jar </li>
<li>servlet.jar</li>
<li>webcontainer.jar</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="skipspace"><span>If they are not present, add them as External JAR files. You may
have your own versions of these files, depending on the level of JDK or Servlet
API for which you are developing.</span></li>
<li class="skipspace"><span>If your Web applications reference other JARs, you can place them
in the build path as follows:</span><ol type="a"><li><span>Use the <span class="uicontrol">Add JARs</span> button on the Library
page. You must ensure that the JAR file is available to the server by properly
configuring the server.</span></li>
<li><span>Add the JARs to the <span class="filepath">WEB-INF/lib</span> directory.
They will be automatically added to the build path and deployed to the server
in as part of the project WAR.</span></li>
