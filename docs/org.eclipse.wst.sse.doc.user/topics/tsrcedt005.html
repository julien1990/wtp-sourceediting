<h1 class="topictitle1">Getting content assistance in structured text editors</h1>
<div><p>To get help in adding markup to a file, you can use content assist
in a structured text editor. Content assist helps you insert or finish a tag
or function or finish a line of code in a structured text editor.</p><div class="skipspace">Content assist also enables you to select and insert templates in
structured text editors. The placement of the cursor in the source file provides
the context for the content assist to offer suggestions for completion.</div>
<div class="p"><span></span> You can request content assist in either of the following
two ways:<ul><li>From the <span class="uicontrol">Edit</span> menu, select <span class="uicontrol">Content
Assist</span></li>
<li>Press Ctrl+Space</li>
</ul>
 <div class="p">In addition, you can set a preference that causes content assist
to pop up automatically when certain characters are typed, such as <samp class="codeph">.</samp> in
the case of JavaScript™ or <samp class="codeph">&lt;</samp> in the case of
HTML and XML. To set this preference, select <span class="uicontrol">Preferences</span> from
the <span class="uicontrol">Window</span> menu, and then select <span class="uicontrol">Web and
XML Files</span>, followed by one of the following sequences:<ul><li><span class="menucascade"><span class="uicontrol">HTML Files</span> &gt; <span class="uicontrol">HTML Source</span></span></li>
<li><span class="menucascade"><span class="uicontrol">JavaScript Files</span> &gt; <span class="uicontrol">JavaScript
Source</span></span></li>
<li><span class="menucascade"><span class="uicontrol">XML Files</span> &gt; <span class="uicontrol">XML Source</span></span></li>
</ul>
In the <span class="uicontrol">Content assist</span> group box, select the <span class="uicontrol">Automatically
make suggestions</span> check box, and supply any additional characters
that should trigger content assist.</div>
<p>If your cursor is in a position
where content assist is available, a pop-up list of all available choices
is displayed. For each of these choices, a brief description of the code is
provided.</p>
