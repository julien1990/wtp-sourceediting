<h1 class="topictitle1">Creating Listeners</h1>

<div>
<p>The listener wizard helps you create application lifecycle
listeners by walking you through the creation process and by providing
you with output files that you can use or that you can modify for use
with your Web application. The listeners can run on Java EE-compliant
Web servers.</p>

<div class="section">
<p>To create a listener, complete the following steps:</p>
</div>

<ol>
	<li class="stepexpand"><span>In the Java EE perspective,
	expand your <a href="ccwebprj.html" title="">dynamic project</a> in the
	Project Explorer view.</span></li>

	<li class="stepexpand"><span>Right click on the <strong>Listener</strong>
	icon, and select <span class="menucascade"> <span
		class="uicontrol">New</span> &gt; <span class="uicontrol">Listener</span></span>
	from the pop-up menu.</span> The <span class="uicontrol">Create Listener</span>
	wizard appears.</li>

	<p>
	<dt class="dlterm">Application lifecycle listeners</dt>
	</p>

	<dd>The <cite>Sun Microsystems Java Servlet Specification</cite> defines the
	following interfaces that represent that application lifecycle
	listeners. You should select at least one of the intefaces. 
	<ul>
		<li><strong>javax.servlet.ServletContextListener:
		</strong> This interface is provided by javax.servlet package and can be used
		to listen to the ServletContext life-cycle events. This interface has
		two methods: contextInitialized and contextDestroyed. The
		<b><i>contextInitialized</i></b> method is called when the web application is ready
		to service requests and the <b><i>contextDestroyed</i></b> method is invoked when
		the servlet context is about to be shut down.</li>
		<li><strong>javax.servlet.ServletContextAttributeListener:
		</strong> This interface is provided by javax.servlet package. It can be used
		to be notified when any attribute is added to the ServletContext or if
		any of the ServletContext's attributes are changed or removed. This
		inetface has three methods: <b><i>attributeAdded, attributeRemoved</i></b> and
		<b><i>attributeReplaced</i></b>.</li>
		<li><strong>javax.servlet.ServletRequestListener:
		</strong> This interface is provided by javax.servlet package. It can be used
		to be notified when a request is coming in or out of scope in a Web
		component. This interface has two methods: requestInitialized and
		requestDestroyed. The <b><i>requestInitialized</i></b> method is called when it is
		about to enter the first servlet or filter in each Web application. The <b><i>requestDestroyed</i></b> method is called when it exits the last servlet
		or the first filter in the chain.</li>
		<li><strong>javax.servlet.ServletRequestAttributeListener:
		</strong> This interface is provided by javax.servlet package and can be used
		to be notified when any request attribute is changed. This interface
		has three methods: attributeAdded, attributeRemoved and
		attributeReplaced. The <b><i>attributteAdded</i></b> method is called when a new
		attribute was added to servlet request. The <b><i>attributeRemoved</i></b> method is
		called when an existing attribute has been removed from the servlet
		request. The <b><i>attributeReplaced</i></b> method is called when an attribute
		was replaced on the servlet request.</li>
		<li><strong>javax.servlet.http.HttpSessionListener:
		</strong> This interface is provided by javax.servlet.http package and can be
		used to listen to a session&apos;s life cycle events. This interface has
		two methods: sessionCreated and sessionDestroyed. The <b><i>sessionCreated</i></b>
		method is called when an HttpSession object is created. The
		<b><i>sessionDestroyed</i></b> method is called when an HttpSession object is
		invalidated.</li>
		<li><strong>javax.servlet.http.HttpSessionActivationListener:
		</strong> This interface is provided by javax.servlet.http package. It can be
		used to listen to a container events notifying that sessions will be
		passivated or activated. This interface has two methods:
		sessionDidActivate and sessionWillPasivate. The <b><i>sessionDidActivate</i></b> is
		called when the session has just been activated and the
		<b><i>sessionWillPasivate</i></b> is called when the session is about to be
		passivated.</li>
		<li><strong>javax.servlet.http.HttpSessionAttributeListener:
		</strong> This interface is provided by javax.servlet.http package and can be
		used to listen to events related to session attributes. This interface
		has three methods: attributeAdded, attributeRemoved and
		attributeReplaced. The <b><i>attributeAdded</i></b> method is called when an
		attribute is added to an HttpSession object. The <b><i>attributeRemoved</i></b> and
		<b><i>attributeReplaced</i></b> methods are called when an HttpSession attribute is
		removed or replaced, respectively.</li>
		<li><strong>javax.servlet.http.HttpSessionBindingListener:
		</strong> This interface is provided by javax.servlet.http package and can be
		used to be notified when an object is bound to or unbound from a
		session. This interface has two methods: valueBound and valueUnbound.
		The <b><i>valueBound</i></b> method is called when the object is being bound to a
		session and identifies the session. The <b><i>valueUnbound</i></b> method is called
		when the object is being unbound from a session and identifies the
		session.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
	<dt class="dlterm">Modifiers</dt>
	</p>

	<dd>The <cite>Sun Microsystems Java Servlet Specification</cite> states that a
	Listener class must be <b>public</b> and not <b>abstract</b>. Therefore,
	you cannot change these modifiers. The only one available for change is
	the <b>final</b> modifier. </dd>

	<p>
	<dt class="dlterm">Interfaces</dt>
	</p>

	<dd>The interfaces that you selected in the previous page of the wizard
	are provided as default values in the <b>Interfaces</b> field. To add
	additional interfaces, click the <b>Add</b> button next to this field.</dd>

	<p>
	<dt class="dlterm">Interfaces dialog</dt>
	</p>

	<dd>This dialog appears if you select to add an interface to your
	servlet. As you type the name of the interface that you are adding, a
	list of available interfaces listed in the <b>Matching items</b> list box
	updates dynamically to display only the interfaces that match the
	pattern. Choose an interface to see the qualifier, and then click <b>OK</b>
	when finished.</dd>
