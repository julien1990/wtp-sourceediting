<h1 class="topictitle1">Workbench integration with Web editors</h1>
<div><p>There are several editors for use in various contexts

for various file types. To edit a file using its default editor, double-click

on the file name in the Project Explorer view, or right-click on the file

and select <span class="uicontrol">Open</span>. The editor that is last used to open

a file becomes the default for that particular file. To edit the file with

a different editor, right-click on the file and select <span class="uicontrol">Open With</span> to

choose from a list of available editors.</p>
<p>In the workbench, you can associate file-name extensions for different

types of resources with various editors. A resource extension can have more

than one editor associated with it; the last editor used for a particular

extension type is indicated by a black dot before it in the <span class="uicontrol">Open

With</span> pop-up menu. You can associate extensions that are known

to the workbench with additional editors, by using the <b>File Associations</b> preferences

page, accessed by selecting <span class="menucascade"><span class="uicontrol">Window</span> &gt; <span class="uicontrol">Preferences</span> &gt; <span class="uicontrol">Workbench</span> &gt; <span class="uicontrol">File Associations</span></span>.</p>
<div class="p">The Properties view provides general capabilities that are advantageous

to Web editor users. <dl><dt class="bold">Properties view</dt>
<dd>The Properties view (<span class="menucascade"><span class="uicontrol">Window</span> &gt; <span class="uicontrol">Show

View</span> &gt; <span class="uicontrol">Properties</span></span>) contains

a list of attributes and editable attribute values. For example, when you

select an image tag <span class="uicontrol">img</span> , the width and height values

appear for editing. In addition, any other attributes allowed by the standard

specified in the DOCTYPE for the file (such as the HTML 4.0.1 DTD) are listed.

When you click the value column of a property, you can select from among the

list of available attribute values. <p>The pop-up menu in the Properties view

enables you to undo, cut, copy, paste, delete, and select all. The options

that are available at a given time depends on where the cursor is located

when you right-click to display the pop-up menu. To see the pop-up menu that

contains undo, cut, and so on, the property value field must be active. (This

is accomplished by selecting the property and then selecting its value.) Otherwise,

the pop-up menu will contain different options.</p>
 <p>Use the <span class="uicontrol">Restore

Default Value</span> button to change any value back to the default setting.</p>
 <p>After

you are in the Properties view, you can modify other property values for specific

tags. To edit another tag using the Properties view, move the cursor within

the editing area of the Source page or Design page to the tag you want to

edit. The appropriate properties and values are displayed in the Properties

view.</p>
