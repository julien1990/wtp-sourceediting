<h1 class="topictitle1">Creating a dynamic Web project</h1>
 <p>You create and maintain the resources for your Web applications

in Web projects. Unlike with <a href="twcresta.html">static</a> Web projects, dynamic Web projects
 enable you to create resources such as JavaServer Pages and servlets.</p>
<p>To create a new dynamic Web project, complete the following steps:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Open the  J2EE perspective</li>
    <li>In the Project Explorer,  right click on Dynamic Web Projects  and select  <b>New</b><b>&gt; Dynamic Web Project</b> from the context menu. </span> The New Dynamic Web Project</span> wizard starts.</li>
    <li>Follow the project wizard prompts<br>  <br> </li>
          </ol>
  <p>
<b>Helpful field information and general terminology</b>
<br>
    <br>
  </p>          

<p><b>Project Facets</b></p>
<p>A facet represents a unit of functionality in a WTP project. For example, the Dynamic Web Module facet enables the project to be deployed as a dynamic web module. A brief description of a project facets appears in the wizard when you select it.<br>
<br>
Note that in many instances, you can view the constraints for a project facet by right clicking on the facet and selecting project constraints from the pop up menu.
</p>

<p><b>Target Runtime</b></p>
<p>Use this field to define a new installed runtime environment. Runtimes are used at build time to compile projects.
</p>

<p><b>Enterprise Application project (EAR Project)</b></p>
<p>A new or existing Enterprise Application project (EAR Project)
must be associated with your new Web project to facilitate deployment. If
you want to override the default settings for the Enterprise Application project,
you can do so using the wizard. When your Web project is created at the end of the wizard, the new Enterprise Application  project is also created with the name specified in the EAR project field. Note that the default is the name of the web project appended with EAR (unless the ear
project was selected when you opened the wizard.)</p>       

<p><b>Context Root</b>
</p>
<p>The context root is the Web application root, which is the top-level directory of your application when it is deployed to the Web server. You can change the context root after you create a project using the project Properties dialog, which you access from the project's pop-up menu. The context root can also be used by the links builder to ensure that your links remain ready to publish as you move and rename files inside your project.
</p>
<!--  <p><b>Servlet Version</b>
</p>
          <li>The following servlet versions correspond to the following J2EE levels:

            <ul>
              <li>version 2.2 - J2EE 1.2</li>
              <li>version 2.3 - J2EE 1.3</li>
              <li>version 2.4 - J2EE 1.4</li>
            </ul>  -->
