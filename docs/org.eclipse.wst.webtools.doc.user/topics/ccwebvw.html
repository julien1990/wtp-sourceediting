<h1 class="topictitle1">Project Explorer view and Web development</h1>
<div><div class="section"><div class="p">The Project Explorer view provides the following notable features: <ul><li><img src="../images/nwin.gif" alt="For Windows"> You can drag and drop files from Windows<sup>&reg;</sup> Explorer or the desktop into
the Navigator view.</li>
<li>View filtering is supported by selecting <span><b>Filters</b></span> from
the Navigator view <span><b>Menu</b></span> button. Resources
can be filtered by name, project type or working set. Files beginning with
a period are filtered out by default.</li>
<li>The status line shows the full path of the selected resource.</li>
<li>Dragging a .java file from the Navigator view into a JSP file will insert
a usebean tag, the same behavior that is exhibited when a .class file is dragged
into a JSP file.</li>
<li>Errors and warnings on resources (including Java&#8482;, HTML/JSP, and Links Builder errors
and warnings) are indicated with a red error <img src="../images/nshowerr.gif" alt="Error icon"> or yellow warning <img src="../images/nwarning.gif" alt="Warning icon"> next to the resource with the error, as well as
the parent containers up to the project. This applies for all project types,
not only Web projects.</li>
<li>Items available from the <span><b>New</b></span> cascading
menu in the project pop-up menu are context sensitive.  All menus will have <span><b>Project</b></span> and <span><b>Other</b></span> options.</li>
<li>All projects are automatically grouped by type. <img src="../images/grptype.gif" alt="Group Project by Type Icon">. </li>
</ul>

<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Organization of the Project Explorer view</h4><p>The Project
Explorer view shows a custom view of a dynamic Web project. By default, dynamic
web projects appear under a top-level category called Dynamic Web Projects.
The following are some of the notable top-level objects that appear beneath
the project node (based on default folder names).</p>
<div class="p"><strong>Web content folder</strong> -
This folder contains items to be published to the server. By default, this
folder will be named <strong>WebContent</strong> for newly created static and dynamic
Web projects. <div class="note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> You can change the name in the Web page of the project's
Properties dialog. In a dynamic Web project, changing the folder name will
update the Java build output directory. You can change the preference
for the default folder name to be applied when creating new Web projects by
selecting <span class="menucascade"><b>Window</b> &gt; <b>Preferences</b> &gt; <b>Web Tools</b> &gt; <b>New J2EE Project</b></span>. </div>
<ul><li><strong>META-INF</strong> - This directory contains the <span class="filepath">MANIFEST.MF</span> file,
which is used to map class paths for dependent JAR files that exist in other
projects in the same Enterprise Application project. An entry in this file
will update the run-time project class path and Java build settings to include the referenced
JAR files.</li>
</ul>
<ul><li><strong>WEB-INF</strong> - The directory where supporting Web resources for a Web
application are kept (for example: .xmi files, .xml files, and web.xml.) Note
that double-clicking on the web.xml file has the same effect as double-clicking
on the Deployment Descriptor: it opens the Web Deployment Descriptor editor.</li>
</ul>
