<h1 class="topictitle1">Project Explorer view and Web development</h1>
<div><div class="skipspace"><div class="p">Depending on the product that you have installed, the Project Explorer view may contain the following features: <ul>


<li><img src="../images/nwin.gif" alt="For Windows" /> You

can drag and drop files from Windows<sup>®</sup> Explorer or the desktop into the

Navigator view.</li>
<li>View filtering is supported by selecting <span><span class="uicontrol">Filters</span></span> from

the Navigator view <span><span class="uicontrol">Menu</span></span> button. Resources

can be filtered by name, project type or working set. Files beginning with

a period are filtered out by default.</li>
<li>The status line shows the full path of the selected resource.</li>
<li>Dragging a .java file from the Navigator view into a JSP file will insert

a usebean tag, the same behavior that is exhibited when a .class file is dragged

into a JSP file.</li>
<li>Errors and warnings on resources (including Java™, HTML/JSP, and Links Builder errors

and warnings) are indicated with a red error <img src="../images/nshowerr.gif" alt="Error icon" /> or yellow warning <img src="../images/nwarning.gif" alt="Warning icon" /> next to the resource with the error,

as well as the parent containers up to the project. This applies for all project

types, not only Web projects.</li>
<li>Items available from the <span><span class="uicontrol">New</span></span> cascading

menu in the project pop-up menu are context sensitive.  All menus will have <span><span class="uicontrol">Project</span></span> and <span><span class="uicontrol">Other</span></span> options.</li>

<li>All projects are automatically grouped by type. </li>

</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="skipspace"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Organization of the Project Explorer view</h4><p>The Project

Explorer view shows a custom view of a dynamic Web project. By default, dynamic

web projects appear under a top-level category called Dynamic Web Projects.

The following are some of the notable top-level objects that appear beneath

the project node (based on default folder names).</p>


</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="p"><b>Web content folder</b> - This folder contains items to be published

to the server. By default, this folder will be named <b>WebContent</b> for

newly created static and dynamic Web projects. <div class="note"><span class="notetitle">Note: </span>You can change the name

in the Web page of the project's Properties dialog. In a dynamic Web project,

changing the folder name will update the Java build output directory. You can change

the preference for the default folder name to be applied when creating new

Web projects by selecting <span class="menucascade"><span class="uicontrol">Window</span> &gt; <span class="uicontrol">Preferences</span> &gt; <span class="uicontrol">Web Tools</span> &gt; <span class="uicontrol">New J2EE Project</span></span>. </div>
<ul><li><b>META-INF</b> - This directory contains the <span class="filepath">MANIFEST.MF</span> file,

which is used to map class paths for dependent JAR files that exist in other

projects in the same Enterprise Application project. An entry in this file

will update the run-time project class path and Java build settings to include the referenced

JAR files.</li>
</ul>
<ul><li><b>WEB-INF</b> - The directory where supporting Web resources for a Web

application are kept (for example: .xmi files, .xml files, and web.xml.) Note

that double-clicking on the web.xml file has the same effect as double-clicking

on the Deployment Descriptor: it opens the Web Deployment Descriptor editor.</li>
</ul>
