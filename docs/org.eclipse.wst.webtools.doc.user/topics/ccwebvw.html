<h1 class="topictitle1">Project Explorer view and Web development</h1>
<div><div class="skipspace"><div class="p">The Project Explorer view is the default view in the Web perspective.

This view provides the following notable features: <ul><li>VCM (version control management) information can be toggled on and off

from the Preferences page (<span class="menucascade"><span class="uicontrol">Window</span> &gt; <span class="uicontrol">Preferences</span> &gt; <span class="uicontrol">Workbench</span> &gt; <span class="uicontrol">Label decorations</span></span>)</li>
<li><img src="../images/nwin.gif" alt="For Windows" /> You

can drag and drop files from Windows<sup>®</sup> Explorer or the desktop into the

Navigator view.</li>
<li>View filtering is supported by selecting <span><span class="uicontrol">Filters</span></span> from

the Navigator view <span><span class="uicontrol">Menu</span></span> button. Resources

can be filtered by name, project type or working set. Files beginning with

a period are filtered out by default.</li>
<li>The status line shows the full path of the selected resource.</li>
<li>Dragging a .java file from the Navigator view into a JSP file will insert

a usebean tag, the same behavior that is exhibited when a .class file is dragged

into a JSP file.</li>
<li>Errors and warnings on resources (including Java™, HTML/JSP, and Links Builder errors

and warnings) are indicated with a red error <img src="../images/nshowerr.gif" alt="Error icon" /> or yellow warning <img src="../images/nwarning.gif" alt="Warning icon" /> next to the resource with the error,

as well as the parent containers up to the project. This applies for all project

types, not only Web projects.</li>
<li>Items available from the <span><span class="uicontrol">New</span></span> cascading

menu in the project pop-up menu are context sensitive.  All menus will have <span><span class="uicontrol">Project</span></span> and <span><span class="uicontrol">Other</span></span> options.</li>
<li>All projects are automatically grouped by type. To see this

view of your projects, click on the <b>Group Project by Type</b> icon <img src="../images/grptype.gif" alt="Group Project by Type Icon" />. </li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="skipspace"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Organization of the Project Explorer view</h4><p>The Project

Explorer view shows a custom view of a dynamic Web project. By default, dynamic

web projects appear under a top-level category called Dynamic Web Projects.

The following are some of the notable top-level objects that appear beneath

the project node (based on default folder names).</p>

<p><b>Web Diagram</b> - A Web

application diagram, is a file that helps you visualize and change

the flow of a Web application.

This file and associated wizard enables you to construct a diagram of a Web

application by clicking on objects in a palette.</p>
<p><b>Web Deployment Descriptor</b> -

This file corresponds to the WebContent/WEB-INF/web.xml file, which is used

to specify deployment information for modules created in the Web development

environment. You can edit this file using the <a href="ccwebxml.html">Web

deployment descriptor editor</a>, or you can select <span><span class="uicontrol">Open

With</span></span> from its pop-up menu to open the file with a different

editor. </p>
<p>Underneath the Deployment Descriptor are placeholders object

that are reserved for the creation of Servlets, Servlet Mappings, Filters,

Filter Mappings, References, Security (constraints and roles) and Listeners.

You can create instances of these objects by right clicking on an object and

selecting <b>New</b> from the pop-up menu.</p>
<div class="p"><b>JavaSource</b> - This

node displays Java resources within the project. If the project contains

a single Java source folder, the packages and classes (for example,

servlets, beans) within the source folder will be shown directly beneath the

JavaSource folder node. If the project contains multiple source folders, each

source folder will appear beneath the JavaSource folder and can be expanded

to show their packages and classes. <div class="note"><span class="notetitle">Note: </span>Though the default name given

to the folder is JavaSource, you can change the name in the Preferences page

by selecting <span class="menucascade"><span class="uicontrol">Window</span> &gt; <span class="uicontrol">Preferences</span> &gt; <span class="uicontrol">Web Tools</span> &gt; <span class="uicontrol">New J2EE Project</span></span>.</div>
<ul><li><b>Libraries</b> - This folder contains the library JAR files defined

in the project properties. Three types of JAR files are shown: <ol><li>JAR files included in the project's WebContent/WEB-INF/lib directory</li>
<li>JAR files external to the project, such as j2ee.jar and rt.jar</li>
<li>Project libraries, which are special references to a Java project</li>
</ol>
<p>When a Web project is exported, a JAR file is automatically created

from the Java project to be used by the Web application during

runtime. Libraries are shown in classpath order. By default, only the JAR

files contained within the project are shown. You can also display external

JARs and project libraries by selecting <span><span class="uicontrol">Show Referenced Libraries</span></span> from

the Navigator view's <span><span class="uicontrol">Menu</span></span> button <img src="../images/menubutton.gif" alt="Menu button" />.</p>
</li>
<li><b>imported_classes folder</b> - This folder can be created during a WAR

import, and contains class files that do not have accompanying source.  The <span class="uicontrol">imported_classes</span> folder

is a Java classes

folder; Java classes folders can also be created using the

Web project <span><span class="uicontrol">Java Build Path</span></span> properties page.<p><img src="../images/nwin.gif" alt="For Windows" /> You can drag

and drop class files from the Windows Explorer or desktop to the <span class="uicontrol">imported_classes</span> folder

in the Navigator view.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="p"><b>Web content folder</b> - This folder contains items to be published

to the server. By default, this folder will be named <b>WebContent</b> for

newly created static and dynamic Web projects. <div class="note"><span class="notetitle">Note: </span>You can change the name

in the Web page of the project's Properties dialog. In a dynamic Web project,

changing the folder name will update the Java build output directory. You can change

the preference for the default folder name to be applied when creating new

Web projects by selecting <span class="menucascade"><span class="uicontrol">Window</span> &gt; <span class="uicontrol">Preferences</span> &gt; <span class="uicontrol">Web Tools</span> &gt; <span class="uicontrol">New J2EE Project</span></span>. </div>
<ul><li><b>META-INF</b> - This directory contains the <span class="filepath">MANIFEST.MF</span> file,

which is used to map class paths for dependent JAR files that exist in other

projects in the same Enterprise Application project. An entry in this file

will update the run-time project class path and Java build settings to include the referenced

JAR files.</li>
</ul>
<ul><li><b>Theme</b> - The suggested directory for cascading style sheets and

other style-related objects.</li>
<li><b>WEB-INF</b> - The directory where supporting Web resources for a Web

application are kept (for example: .xmi files, .xml files, and web.xml.) Note

that double-clicking on the web.xml file has the same effect as double-clicking

on the Deployment Descriptor: it opens the Web Deployment Descriptor editor.</li>
