<h1 class="topictitle1">Creating JavaServer Pages (JSP) files</h1>
<div><div class="skipspace"> <p>You can create and edit a JSP file,
HTML file, or JSP tagging. This includes placing Java™ source code inside of scriptlet tags.
</p>
 <div class="p">Most types of JSP files can be
created using the New JSP File wizard.
 </div>
To create a basic JSP file using the JSP file wizard, complete the
following steps: </div>
<ol><li class="skipspace"><span>Create a dynamic Web project if you have not already done so.</span></li>
<li class="skipspace"><span>Open the <b>Web</b> perspective.</span></li>
<li class="skipspace"><span>Select the Web project, and then select <span class="menucascade"><span class="uicontrol">File</span> &gt; <span class="uicontrol">New</span> &gt; <span class="uicontrol">JSP File</span></span>.</span> The New JSP File window appears.</li>
<li class="skipspace"><span>Select the <b>Browse</b> button and select an appropriate container
for the file from the list of project folders (and subfolders). </span> <p>The
folder that you choose should be under the Web content folder of a dynamic
Web project. If a JSP file is <i>not</i> under this folder, then it will not
be included in the WAR file that is deployed to the server. In addition, link
validation will not encompass files that are not under the Web content folder.</p>
</li>
<li class="skipspace"><span>Type a file name into the appropriate field.</span></li>
<li class="skipspace"><span>Ensure that the appropriate option is displayed in the <span class="uicontrol">Markup
language</span> drop-down list. </span> Note that the option you
choose will determine the model of JSP that appears in the <b>Model</b> pull-down
list.<p>In addition, if you select the <span class="uicontrol">Create as JSP fragment</span> check
box, this file will be created as a fragment that can be added to another
JSP file. Other JSP files can include JSP fragments using a JSP include directive.
Creating a fragment causes the resulting file to end in a .jspf or .jsf extension.
You will not be prompted for DOCTYPE information, because a fragment cannot
stand alone as a Web page, and it would invalidate any JSP file that included
it.</p>
 <p>Also, depending on the markup language you select, you can select
the <span class="uicontrol">Use XML style syntax</span> option to create a JSP file
that adheres to XML style tagging.</p>
</li>
<li class="skipspace"><span> You have several options for proceeding: (Note that the windows
that appear in this wizard are determined by the options that you select) </span><ul><li>To accept the defaults associated with a new JSP file, select <span class="uicontrol">None</span> in
the <span class="uicontrol">Model</span> drop-down list, and  then select <span class="uicontrol">Finish</span>. </li>
<li> To use one of the sample templates provided, select <span class="uicontrol">Create
from page template</span>, and then select <b>Next</b>. (Note that this
is only available for HTML and XHTML markup languages.) If you choose this
option, a window appears in which you can choose a sample template or a user-defined
template.</li>
<li>If you want to specify or customize the file options, select the <span class="uicontrol">Configure
advanced options</span> check box and click <span class="uicontrol">Next</span>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="skipspace"><span> Click the <span class="uicontrol">Add</span> button to locate a Tag Library
Descriptor (TLD) file or a JAR file that contains a TLD file to add tag libraries
from a variety of sources.</span> <p>Tag library Universal Resource Identifier
(URIs) can be located in one of the following places:</p>
<ul><li>Defined in the web.xml file</li>
<li>Within a JAR file located in the project lib directory that contains /META-INF/taglib.tld</li>
<li>Within a JAR file external to the project</li>
<li>In a "loose" TLD anywhere in the project</li>
</ul>
<ol type="a"><li class="skipspace"><span>In the <span class="uicontrol">Select a tag library</span> dialog, either
select one of the available tag libraries, or click the <span class="uicontrol">Import</span> button
to locate and add a tag library to the list, and then select it.</span> The
dialog will automatically populate the informational fields that describe
the tag library and its contents. You must specify a <span class="uicontrol">Prefix</span> value.</li>
<li class="skipspace"><span>Click <span class="uicontrol">OK</span> to add the tag library.</span> Note that if the selected TLD files hasn't been registered in
the web.xml file, it will be added automatically.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li class="skipspace"><span>Click <span class="uicontrol">Next</span>.</span></li>
<li class="skipspace"><span>If you want to select an encoding type, deselect the <span class="uicontrol">Use
workbench encoding</span> check box to select a new encoding attribute.
Select the appropriate encoding value to add to the file's HTML declaration
from the <span class="uicontrol">Encoding</span> drop-down list.</span> The default
is the value set in the <span class="uicontrol">HTML Files</span> preferences page,
which is accessed by selecting <span class="uicontrol">Window &gt; Preferences</span>,
and then expanding the <span class="uicontrol">Web and XML Files</span> preferences.</li>
<li class="skipspace"><span>Ensure that the proper content type is selected in the <span class="uicontrol">Content
Type</span> drop-down list. The default depends on the markup language.</span></li>
<li class="skipspace"><span>Select the <span class="uicontrol">Document Type</span> that you wish to
associate with the JSP file. The default depends on the markup language.</span></li>
<li class="skipspace"><span>Specify a cascading style sheet (CSS) file to be referenced by
the new JSP file. Typically, CSS files are located in the theme folder under
the Web content folder. You can use <b>Add</b> to choose a style sheet from
the file system. Use <b>Remove</b> to delete a style sheet from the list,
or use the arrow buttons to rearrange the order in which the file references
the style sheets. If a style sheet is already associated with the project
in which you are creating the new file, that style sheet is the default.</span></li>
<li class="skipspace"><span>Click <span class="uicontrol">Next</span> to select specific method stubs
and add deployment information to the Web project's web.xml file. </span> <p>Select
any appropriate method stubs to be created in the servlet that is deployed
for this JSP file.</p>
<p>If you select the <span class="uicontrol">Add to web.xml</span> check
box, the JSP file, along with its display name, and any URL mappings and initialization
parameters associated with the JSP file will be automatically included in
the Web project deployment descriptor file. Note that the <span class="uicontrol">File
Name</span> value provided in the first page of the wizard is automatically
mapped to the <span class="uicontrol">Servlet Name</span> value on this page, as well
the <span class="uicontrol">URL Pattern</span> mappings. These mappings are not updated
if you change the original value in the <span class="uicontrol">File Name</span> field.</p>
</li>
<li class="skipspace"><span>Click <span class="uicontrol">Finish</span> to create the file in the project
that you have selected.</span></li>
