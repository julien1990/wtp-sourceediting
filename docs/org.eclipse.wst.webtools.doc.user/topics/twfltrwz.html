<h1 class="topictitle1">Creating a new filter class</h1>
<div><div class="skipspace"> <p> The Filter wizard enables you to create Java™ filter

classes for various J2EE filter types, such as authentication filters, encryption

filters, and data compression filters.</p>
<p>To create a filter class, do

the following: </p>
</div>
<ol><li class="skipspace"><span>Open the Filter wizard. To do this:</span><ol type="a"><li><span>Open the Web perspective and display the Project Explorer view.</span></li>
<li><span>Expand the project in which you want to create the filter</span></li>
<li><span>Expand the deployment descriptor icon</span></li>
<li><span>Right click on the <b>Filters</b> icon.</span></li>
<li><span>Select <span class="menucascade"><span class="uicontrol">New</span> &gt; <span class="uicontrol">Filter</span></span> from the pop-up menu.</span></li>
</ol>
  The <span class="uicontrol">Create Filter</span> wizard appears.  </li>
<li class="skipspace"><span>Type a name and description for the filter. Notice that the name

that you type in the <b>Name</b> field is used to create a URL Mapping for

the filter. Optionally add initialization parameters or an alternative URL

mapping, and then select <b>Next</b>.</span></li>
<li class="skipspace"><span>Specify the folder where the filter class will be placed. (You

should place the filter in the Java source folder) Also specify the package

that the class will belong to (it is added into a default package if you do

not specify one), and the class name of the filter. </span></li>
<li class="skipspace"><span>Specify a superclass for the filter class. A filter created by

this wizard can have any class that has Object in its hierarchy as its superclass.

Click <span class="uicontrol">Browse</span> to choose from the available superclasses.

When finished select <b>Next</b>.</span></li>
<li class="skipspace"><span>Select a modifier to specify whether your filter class is public,

abstract, or final. (Classes cannot be both abstract and final.)</span></li>
<li class="skipspace"><span>The javax.servlet.Filter is provided as the default <span><span class="uicontrol">Interface</span></span>.

You do not have to implement the Filter interface if you subclass a class

that implements Filter, or if you implement an interface which has Filter

in its hierarchy. </span> <p>You can also add additional interfaces to

implement. Click <span><span class="uicontrol">Add</span></span> to open the <span><span class="uicontrol">Interface

Selection</span></span> dialog. In this dialog, as you type the name of

the interface that you are interested in adding in the <span><span class="uicontrol">Choose

interfaces</span></span> field, the list of available interfaces listed

in the <span><span class="uicontrol">Matching types</span></span> list box updates dynamically

to display only the interfaces that match the pattern. Select an interface

to see the <span><span class="uicontrol">Qualifier</span></span> and click <span><span class="uicontrol">Add</span></span>.

Click <span><span class="uicontrol">OK</span></span> when you are finished. The qualifier

that you chose appears in the Interfaces dialog.</p>
</li>
<li class="skipspace"><span>Choose which method stub you want to create.</span> <p>The <span><span class="uicontrol">Inherited

abstract methods</span></span> option adds stubs for inherited abstract

methods, and that must be implemented (unless you intend to create an abstract

class). Because the init(), destroy(), and doFilter() methods are all defined

in the javax.servlet.Filter interface, stubs for these methods are automatically

generated for each new filter class.</p>
</li>
<li class="skipspace"><span>Click <span><span class="uicontrol">Finish</span></span>.</span></li>
</ol>
<div class="skipspace">The filter that you created appears under the Filters icon.</div>
