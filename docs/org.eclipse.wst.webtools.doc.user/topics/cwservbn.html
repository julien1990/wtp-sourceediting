<h1 class="topictitle1">Servlets</h1>
<div><p>Servlets are server-side Java™ programs that use the <cite>Sun Microsystems Java Servlet

API</cite> and its associated classes and methods, as defined in the <cite>Sun

Microsystems Java Servlet 2.3 Specification</cite>. These Java programs

extend the functionality of a Web server by generating dynamic content and

responding to Web client requests. When a browser sends a request to the server,

the server can send the request information to a servlet, so that the servlet

can construct the response that is sent back to the browser.</p>
<p>Just as applets run on a Web browser and extend the browser's capabilities,

servlets run on a Java-enabled Web server, such as the WebSphere<sup>®</sup> Application

Server and extend the server's capabilities. Because of their flexibility

and scalability, servlets are commonly used to enable businesses to connect

databases to the Web.</p>
<div class="p">Although a servlet can be a completely self-contained program, you can

split application development into two portions:  <ul><li>The business logic (content generation), which governs the relationship

between input, processing, and output</li>
<li>The presentation logic (content presentation, or graphic design rules),

which determines how information is presented to the user</li>
</ul>
Using this paradigm, you may choose to have business logic handled by Java beans,

the presentation logic handled by JavaServer Pages (JSP) or HTML files, and

the HTTP protocol handled by a servlet. <div class="note"><span class="notetitle">Note: </span>JSP files can be used to manage

both the presentation and business logic for a Web application. JSP files

use structured markup for presentation, and supply servlet model behavior

at run time.</div>
</div>
<p>You can develop, debug, and deploy servlets, set breakpoints within servlet objects, and step through

code to make changes that are dynamically folded into the running servlet

on a running server, without having to restart each time.</p>
<p>For more information about servlets, refer to the <cite>Sun Microsystems Java Servlet

2.3 Specification</cite> at <samp class="codeph">java.sun.com/products/servlet/download.html</samp>.</p>
