<title>The Web perspective</title>

<h1 class="topictitle1">The Web perspective</h1>
<p>The Web perspective combines views and editors that assist you with Web

application development. This is the perspective in which you typically edit

Web project resources, such as HTML and JSP files, and deployment descriptors.</p>
<p>The following are some of the views that are helpful when developing Web

applications in the Web perspective.</p>
<dl>
<dt class="bold">Colors</dt>
<dd>Allows you to apply colors from a palette (or custom colors) to selected
objects in the editing area.</dd>
<dt class="bold">Gallery</dt>
<dd>Contains a variety of catalogs of reusable files that can be applied to
Web pages. The file types available include images, wallpaper, sound
files, and style sheet files.</dd>
<dt class="bold">Page Data</dt>
<dd>Allows you manage data from a variety of sources such as JavaBeans™,
and Web Services, which can be configured and dropped onto a JSP page.</dd>
<dt class="bold">Palette</dt>
<dd>Contains expandable drawers of drag and drop objects. Allows you to drag
objects, such as tables or form buttons, onto the Design or Source page.</dd>
<dt class="bold">Problems</dt>
<dd>Shows list of errors, warnings, and information about an operation. For
example, if there are errors when validating the code in an HTML file, the
errors will appear in this list. </dd>
<dt class="bold">Properties</dt>
<dd>Provides tabbed pages that allow you to update properties for tags selected
in files open in the active Web editor. Changes to property value text fields
are reflected in the edited file immediately when cursor focus is changed,
or when you press the Enter key. In addition, changes to any of the controls
in the Properties view are immediately reflected in the edited file.</dd>
<dt class="bold">Quick Edit</dt>
<dd>Allows you to edit small bits of code, including adding and editing actions
assigned to tags. You can drag and drop items from the Snippets view into
the Quick Edit view.</dd>
<dt class="bold">Servers</dt>
<dd>Lists servers defined for the project and their status.</dd>
<dt class="bold">Snippets</dt>
<dd>Contains expandable drawers of drag and drop code snippets. For instance,
you can add JavaScript™ macros that become part of the user interface
(UI), like a script to display the date and time when the page was last updated.
If you are working in a JSP file, you can add common JSP code. You can drag
and drop code snippets into the Design and Source pages, as well as the Quick
Edit view.</dd>
<dt class="bold">Styles</dt>
<dd>Provides guided editing for cascading style sheets and individual style
definitions for HTML elements.</dd>
<dt class="bold">Tasks</dt>
<dd>Shows a list of "to do" items that you create and to which you assign priorities. To create a task, right click in the list and select <b>Add Task</b> from the pop-up menu. 
</dd>
<dt class="bold">Thumbnails</dt>
<dd>Shows thumbnails of the images in the selected project, folder, or file.
When used with the Gallery view, thumbnail also displays the contents of a selected folder.
You can drag and drop from this view into the Project Explorer view.</dd>
</dl>
<p>There are other views in this perspective that you might find useful. To

add more views, select <span class="menucascade"><span class="uicontrol">Window</span> &gt; <span class="uicontrol">Show

View</span></span> from the menu bar. You can close, resize, or

move any of the views.</p>
