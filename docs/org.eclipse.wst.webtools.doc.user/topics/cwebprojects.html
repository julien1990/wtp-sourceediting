<h1 class="topictitle1">Web projects</h1>
<div><p>Web projects hold all of the Web resources that

are created and used when developing your Web application. The first step

to creating or importing a Web application is to create either a static or

a dynamic Web project. Static Web projects are meant to contain only simple

Web site resources, such as HTML files. Dynamic Web projects are used to structure

Web applications that will use more complicated, dynamic Web technologies,

such as JavaServer Pages files, and possibly data access resources.</p>
<p>Though the Web project is structured on your file system in compliance

with the J2EE Web application standard for deployment purposes, the Project

Explorer view is designed to show the most convenient display of project resources

for use while you are actually developing the Web application. When you are

finished developing your Web application, you use the Web project to deploy

the correct resources to the server. These resources will be packaged in a

file called a Web archive, or WAR file.</p>
