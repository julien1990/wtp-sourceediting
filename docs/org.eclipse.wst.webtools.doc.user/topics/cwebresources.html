<h1 class="topictitle1">Web resources</h1>
<div><p>In most cases, all of the resources that you need to create for your Web

application are developed during Web site or Web page design; however, there

are additional resources that you may need to include in your Web project

if you are using more advanced Web technologies in your application.</p>
<p>These Web resources are not typical Web page files, and are often not the

resources that you consider part of the final Web site. For example, tag libraries

and Java™ resources,

such as JAR files, are resources you might need to include in your Web project.
</p>
<p>In fact, even the WAR file itself could be considered a Web resource, if

you consider importing or exporting the resource.</p>
