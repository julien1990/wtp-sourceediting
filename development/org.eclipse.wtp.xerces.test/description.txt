This test bundle was created to have a simplified way to investigate interaction of 
JREs and Xerces bundle. See also https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=283721

It is written as an Eclpse App, which gets several methods to get a SAXParserFactory, 
and subsequently gets a parser from that Factory. 

This is normally straightforward and everything works fine, BUT, when using some JREs
(such as IBM's JRE) and also having the xerces bundle on the classpath, then there 
are some cases where classcast exceptions are thrown. 

The tests show that 

Using direct instantiation, seems to work fine. Namely, SAXParserFactory.newInstance(). 

Using the oft recommended context class loader seems to work fine, if and only if called first, 
in that bundle. 

Trying to use the OSGI service to get the SAX Factory will fail, as it returns 
one from the JRE, but the bundle is using classes from the xerces bundle. 

Presumably when the context classloader is set, and none yet exist in the registry, 
then apparently, xerces finds the correct 
factory to return, and must create and store in the service registry, specific to that 
bundle context. 

The  context classloader technique will fail, if the OSGi service method has already 
been called.
