	Server Tools API Resolution and Plan:
	   
	   Add concept of "web feature" as an extension of project nature
	   Ted will document, open bugzilla feature requests, and "drive" review
	       (implementation is partially BEA, partially IBM)
	       request review of Marshall Culpepper@jboss.org
	       
	
	Flexible Project resolution and Plan:
	
		Multiple components per project - not default (in UI), but capability is there.
