		Review Arch. snapshot. (and proposed movement of components.), 
			-- issues logged
					
		
		Overview of SSE philosophy and primary models and flow
		
		Discuss overall/general appropriatness of "EMF Model based API". 
		(such as the proposed J2EE and WSDL APIs). 
		  -- resolved "approprite", and "EMF API" is ok as API
		     (wouldn't hurt to verify and/or write down what's expected,
		     how to use). 
		  -- suggested packages heavily/directly dependendent on emf, should have 
		     'emf' in them (if not otherwise marked internal), 
		     to make clear that clients were building in that
		     dependancy 
		     ?EObject's too?

			Tests - "sit down" tests, grow into unit tests.
					Java Search and flexible projects (can "hits" find source?).
					Flex project interaction with logical resources? - Discuss integration ... R1.1 item
					Java Refactoring and flexible projects (do "dependancies" update correctly).
					Do "virtual resources" maintain correct resource markers?
					Do "virtual resources" do validateEdit correctly
