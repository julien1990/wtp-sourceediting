		Review Arch. snapshot. (and proposed movement of components.), 
			-- issues logged
					
		
		Overview of SSE philosophy and primary models and flow
		    -- everyone loved it :)
		
		Discuss overall/general appropriatness of "EMF Model based API". 
		(such as the proposed J2EE and WSDL APIs). 
		  -- resolved "approprite", and "EMF API" is ok as API
		     (wouldn't hurt to verify and/or write down what's expected,
		     how to use). 
		  -- it was suggested packages heavily/directly dependendent on emf, should have 
		     'emf' in them (if not otherwise marked internal), 
		     to make clear that clients were building in that
		     dependancy 
		     
		     

	Server Tools API Resolution and Plan:
	   
	   Add concept of "web feature" as an extension of project nature
	   Ted will document, open bugzilla feature requests, and "drive" review
	       (implementation is partially BEA, partially IBM)
	       request review of Marshall Culpepper@jboss.org
	       
	
	Flexible Project resolution and Plan:
	
		Resolved, allow multiple components per project (as is) 
		- but not default (as UI currently is), but capability is there.
