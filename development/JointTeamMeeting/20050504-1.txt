		Review Arch. snapshot. (and proposed movement of components.), 
			-- issues logged
					
		
		Overview of SSE philosophy and primary models and flow
		    -- everyone loved it :)
		
		Discuss overall/general appropriatness of "EMF Model based API". 
		(such as the proposed J2EE and WSDL APIs). 
		  -- resolved "approprite", and "EMF API" is ok as API
		     (wouldn't hurt to verify and/or write down what's expected,
		     how to use). 
		  -- suggested packages heavily/directly dependendent on emf, should have 
		     'emf' in them (if not otherwise marked internal), 
		     to make clear that clients were building in that
		     dependancy 
		     ?EObject's too?
