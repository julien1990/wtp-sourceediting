Description of this project: 

A small demo of issues with huge amounts of 
StyleRanges being "sent" to StyledText. 

To see, run the MinimalEditor class as an SWT Application. 


data1 and data2 folders contain some data and charts 
which appear to show that StyledText does quite well 
for a few hundred (even a few thousand) StyledRanges, but 
that this appears to be the "tip" of an exponetial curve? 
(well, probably not really exponential, just non-linear, and 
way way too slow for 20 thousand StyleRanges.
