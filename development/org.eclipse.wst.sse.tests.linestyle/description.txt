Description of this project: 

A small demo of issues with huge amounts of 
StyleRanges being "sent" to StyledText. 

To see test run continuously, run the 
MinimalEditor class as an SWT Application. 


To run as a "JUnit Performance Test" run the 
TestManyStyledRanges class as a Plugin JUnit Test. 

data1 and data2 folders contain some data and charts 
which appear to show that StyledText does quite well 
for a few hundred (even a few thousand) StyledRanges, but 
that this appears to be the "tip" of an exponetial curve? 
(well, probably not really exponential, just non-linear, and 
way way too slow for 20 thousand StyleRanges. 


Note, the data3 folder was added with results obtained 
on my machine using the latest version of this test. 
It seems to be generally faster, but still non-linear. 
I'm thinking perhaps in earlier tests there were bugs 
that caused some style ranges to overlap with one another. 
(would that cause extra processing?). 

At any rate, the data3 results show a difference between 
Linux and Windows, but the machines also have different 
processors, graphic chips, etc., so not sure what 
that indicates. I ran the tests on both platforms, just 
to make sure it did run on both platforms.
