Notes on M3 Milestone Plan

        JSP taglib -- remove/defer flexible project tie-in

        CSS Validation - Jens will look at

        Folding -- won't complete, maybe work-in-progress

        Documentation, API ... clarify first drafts for M3

        TODO: need to get examples built as part of SDK build
                (probably an M4 item, may take custom build scripts?

        Jens will create bugzilla with example cheatsheet editor as zip file,
                to be checked into xml examples

------


EclispeCon Sprint Session:

        overview -- philosopfy and goals
                model manager
                parsers/models (e.g. not strict XML)

        Jens - cheat sheet editor

        mutipage editors -- Nitin.

        validation and source page validation - ?

        -- adapter factories? too complex for sprint session, and
           probably want to limit exposure since some behavior is not settled

        breakpoint support? - will not be API

        Snippets view? - does need to be API


-- next meeting, look to change time to 11 so 6 hour time diff isn't so great.
