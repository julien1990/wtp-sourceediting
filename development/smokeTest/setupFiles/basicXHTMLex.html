An example XHTML Basic document
</title>
</head>
<body>

<p>This is an example of a document which conforms with XHTML Basic.</p>
<p>Notice how I cannot directly place plain text within the body tags. I must wrap this within p tags.
<P>Also notice how I need to <br>close my br tag.</P>
<table>
	<tr>
		<td>**</td>
		<td>Please note, you can use tables. But you cannot have other tables within tables.<br>
		There are also no border attributes or width attributes on tables.</td>
		<td>**</td>
	</tr>
</table>

<h1>This is a header</h1>

<p>The end.
